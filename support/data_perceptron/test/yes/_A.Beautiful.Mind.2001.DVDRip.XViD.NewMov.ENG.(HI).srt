PRINCETON UNIVERSITY - SEPTEMBER 1947
Mathematicians won the war.
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes...
Mathematicians, like you.
In medicine or economics...
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?
The next Einstein?
MAN 1: It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.
MAN 2: No, he wants it all for himself.
It's the first time the Carnegie Prize
has been split. Hansen's all bent.
MAN 1: He has his sights set on
Wheeler Lab, MIT's military think-tank.
MAN 2: Hansen's used to
being picked first.
MAN 1: Yeah, he's wasted on math.
MAN 2: He should be running for president.
There could be a mathematical explanation
for how bad your tie is.
NEILSON: Thank you.
Neilson, symbol cryptography.
Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.
At least that's what he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?
The name's Bender. Atomic physics.
NEILSON: And you are?
SOL: Am I late?
BENDER: Yes, Mr. Sol.
SOL: Oh, good. Hi.
SOL: Sol. Richard Sol.
MARTIN: The burden of genius.
MARTIN: Bender.
BENDER: Nice to see you.
BENDER: Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
MARTIN: Thank you.
I'll take another.
Excuse me?
MARTIN: Pardon me.
I assumed you were the waiter.
BENDER: Play nice.
SOL: Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.
MARTIN: Honest mistake.
It is Martin, isn't it?
Why, yes, John, it is.
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.
I've read your preprints...
The one on Nazi ciphers...
on nonlinear equations...
that there is not a single seminal...
Enjoy your punch.
Gentlemen, meet John Nash...
BENDER: Okay.
SOL: Yeah?
BENDER: Of course.
CHARLES: [Coughs] Oh, Christ.
The prodigal roommate arrives.
Roommate?
Oh, God, no.
CHARLES: Did you know that
having a hangover...
in your body...
So, dying of thirst...
John Nash?
Hello.
Charles Herman.
Pleased to meet you.
PLAYER: [Outside] All right! Well done!
CHARLES: Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.
Whew.
CHARLES: Well, I got in last night
in time for...
Cock was mine...
lovely young thing with a passion for...
You're not easily distracted, are you?
I see. Crikey!
Is my roommate a dick?
Hmm?
Listen.
If we can't break the ice...
CHARLES: So what's your story?
Despite my privileged upbringing,
I'm well-balanced.
I have a chip on both shoulders.
Maybe you're just better with
the old integers than you are with people.
JOHN: My first grade teacher said
I was born with two helpings of brain...
CHARLES: Wow! She sounds lovely!
The truth is that I...
I don't like people much.
And they don't much like me.
But why,
with all your obvious wit and charm?
Seriously, John.
Mathematics...
Mathematics is never going to lead you
to a higher truth.
And you know why?
Because it's boring. It's really boring.
You know, half these schoolboys
are already published?
I cannot waste time
with these classes and...
Memorizing the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals!
I need to look through...
Find a truly original idea.
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.
Yes.
MARTIN: All right, who's next?
SOL: I've played enough go for today.
Cowards, all of you!
None of you rise to meet my challenge?
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,
Sol does his laundry all semester.
MARTIN: Look at him.
BENDER: Nash!
Taking a reverse constitutional?
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm
to define their movement.
Oh.
Psycho.
SOL: I thought you dropped out.
You ever going to go to class or...
Classes will dull your mind.
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.
Which is another way of saying
he doesn't have the nerve to compete.
You scared?
Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.
Stupefied by you.
No starch.
Pressed and folded.
Let me ask you something, John.
Be my guest, Martin.
Bender and Sol here correctly completed
Allen's proof of Perron's conjectures.
JOHN: Adequate work...
MARTIN: And I've got two weapons briefs
under security review by the DOD.
Derivative drivel.
But Nash achievements: zero.
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual question coming?
What if you never come up
with your original idea?
MARTIN: How will it feel
when I'm chosen for Wheeler...
What if you lose?
You should not have won.
Hmm.
I had the first move, my play was perfect.
The hubris of the defeated.
The game is flawed.
MARTIN: Gentlemen, the great John Nash.
CHARLES: You've been in here
for two days.
You know Hansen
has just published another paper?
I can't even find a topic for my doctorate.
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.
This is a group playing touch football.
John, you watched a mugging.
That's weird.
In competitive behavior,
someone always loses.
Well, my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.
See, if I could derive an equilibrium...
a non-singular event...
Imagine the effect that would have
on conflict scenarios...
When did you last eat?
You know, food.
You have no respect for cognitive reverie,
you know?
Yes. But pizza...
Now, pizza I have enormous respect for.
And, of course, beer.
I have respect for beer.
I have respect for beer!
BENDER: Good evening, Neils.
MARTIN: Hey, Nash.
Who's winning? You or you?
BENDER: Good evening, Nash.
SOL: Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.
WOMAN: He's looking at you for sure.
Hey, Nash.
BENDER: You're joking.
SOL: Oh, no.
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success...
This is going to be classic.
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.
I don't know what I'm required to say...
to have intercourse with me...
that I've said all that?
Essentially we're talking about
fluid exchange, right?
So, could we just go straight to the sex?
Oh, that was sweet.
WOMAN: Have a nice night, asshole!
NEILSON: Ladies, wait!
CHARLES: I especially liked the bit
about fluid exchange. It was...
PROFESSOR: Walk with me, John.
The faculty is completing mid-year reviews.
We're deciding
which placement applications to support.
Wheeler, sir.
That would be my first choice.
JOHN: Actually, I don't really have
a second choice, sir.
Your fellows have attended classes.
They've written papers. They've published.
I'm still searching, sir, for my...
It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid
it's just not nearly good enough.
I'm working on manifold embedding.
My bargaining stratagems
show some promise.
If you could just arrange another meeting
with Professor Einstein.
I've repeatedly asked you for that.
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...
John.
Do you see what they're doing there?
PROFESSOR 2:
Congratulations, Professor Max.
MAX: Thank you, sir. Thank you.
It's the pens.
Reserved for a member of the department
that makes the achievement of a lifetime.
Now what do you see, John?
Recognition.
Well done, Professor.
Well, try seeing accomplishment.
Is there a difference?
You haven't focused.
I'm sorry, but up to this point, your record
doesn't warrant any placement at all.
Good day.
PROFESSOR:
And my compliments to you, sir.
MAX: Thank you so much.
JOHN: I can't see it.
CHARLES: Jesus Christ, John.
I can't fail.
JOHN: This is all I am.
CHARLES: Come on, let's go out.
JOHN: Got to face the wall,
follow their rules, read their books...
Come on! Go on, bust your head!
Kill yourself.
CHARLES: Don't do it. Don't mess around.
Bust your head! Go on,
bust that worthless head wide open.
JOHN: Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?
It's not my problem.
And it's not your problem.
It's their problem.
CHARLES: Your answer isn't,
That was heavy.
That Isaac Newton fellow was right.
JOHN: Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.
CHARLES: [Laughing] Oh, God.
NEILSON: Incoming, gentlemen.
SOL: Ay-yi-yi.
Deep breaths.
SOL: Nash, you might want to stop
shuffling your papers for five seconds.
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.
BENDER: We're not here for beer,
my friend.
JOHN: Oh.
Does anyone else feel
she should be moving in slow motion?
Will she want a large wedding, you think?
Shall we say swords? Pistols at dawn?
Have you remembered nothing?
SOL<i>I</i>NEILSON: "...individual ambition
serves the common good."
Every man for himself, gentlemen.
BENDER: Those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.
MARTIN: I'm not going to strike out.
SOL: You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.
SOL: Nobody move.
MARTIN: Oh, God.
He may have the upper hand now...
BENDER: That was one
for the history books.
If we all go for the blonde...
Well, what if no one goes for the blonde?
That's the only way we win.
That's the only way we all get laid.
Adam Smith said:
doing what's best for himself."
Right. Incomplete. Okay?
Because the best result will come...
If this is some way for you
to get the blonde, go to hell.
Governing dynamics. Adam Smith...
SOL: Here we go.
NEILSON: Careful, careful.
Thank you.
You do realize this flies in the face
of 150 years of economic theory?
Yes, I do, sir.
Well, Mr. Nash...
PROFESSOR: Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.
Sol and Bender, sir.
Sol and Bender
are extraordinary mathematicians.
Has it occurred to you that Sol and Bender
might have plans of their own?
BENDER: [Laughing] We made it!
Wheeler, we made it!
Cheers, cheers, cheers!
Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.
Umm...
Governing dynamics.
MARTIN: Congratulations, John.
BENDER: Toast! To Wheeler Labs!
SOL: To Wheeler!
THE PENTAGON 1953 - FIVE YEARS LATER
MAN: General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.
Dr. Nash, your coat?
Thank you, sir.
General, this is Wheeler team leader,
Dr. John Nash.
Right this way.
GENERAL: We've been intercepting
radio transmissions from Moscow.
JOHN: Why is that, General?
GENERAL: Ever just know something,
Dr. Nash?
Constantly.
GENERAL: We've developed
several ciphers.
GENERAL: Doctor?
JOHN: [Voiceover] 6-7-3-7.
I need a map.
JOHN: 46-13-08, 67-46-90.
These are latitudes and longitudes.
There are at least 10 others.
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.
Extraordinary.
Gentlemen, we need to move on this.
Accompany Dr. Nash.
What are the Russians moving, General?
Captain Rogers will escort you
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.
ROGERS: Dr. Nash, follow me, please.
DRIVER: It's Dr. Nash.
GUARD: All right.
WHEELER DEFENSE LABS
MIT CAMPUS
Have they actually taken the word
Hi. The air conditioning broke again.
How am I supposed to be in here
saving the world if I'm melting?
Our hearts go out to you.
Two trips to the Pentagon in four years.
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.
You know, the Russians have the H-bomb,
the Nazis are repatriating South America...
of 2.8 million...
You made the cover of <i>Fortune</i> again.
Please note the use of the word "you,"
not "we."
That was supposed to be just me.
Not only do they rob me
of the Fields' Medal...
of <i>Fortune</i> magazine with these hacks...
Exactly what's the difference
between genius and most genius?
Quite a lot.
He's your son.
Anyway, you've got 10 minutes.
JOHN: I've always got 10 minutes.
BENDER: Before your new class?
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?
You are a doctor, John, and no.
You know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities...
teaching their great minds of tomorrow.
The bell is ringing.
The eager young minds of tomorrow.
STUDENT: Can we leave one open,
Professor? It's really hot, sir.
Your comfort comes second
to my ability to hear my own voice.
JOHN: Personally...
However, here we are.
So you may attend or not.
You may complete your assignments
at your whim.
Miss.
ALICIA: Excuse me!
ALICIA: Excuse me!
FOREMAN: Hey, hey!
ALICIA: Hi!
FOREMAN: Not a problem.
ALICIA: Thank you so much!
FOREMAN: Break!
WORKER: Got it!
FOREMAN: Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.
As you will find in multivariable calculus,
there is often...
for any given problem.
As I was saying, this problem here...
For others among you...
of your natural lives.
PARCHER: Professor Nash.
William Parcher.
Big Brother...
What can I do
for the Department of Defense?
Oppenheimer used to say, "A genius
sees the answer before the question."
You knew Oppenheimer?
His project was under my supervision.
Which project?
JOHN: That project.
PARCHER: It's not that simple.
Well, you ended the war.
We incinerated 150,000 people
in a heartbeat.
Great deeds come at great cost,
Mr. Parcher.
Conviction, it turns out, is a luxury
of those on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.
I'll try and keep that in mind.
PARCHER: So, John, no family...
PARCHER: Why is that?
JOHN: I like to think it's because I'm a Ione wolf.
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.
There are certain endeavors...
would be considered an advantage.
JOHN: This is a secure area.
PARCHER: They know me.
PARCHER: Have you ever been here?
JOHN: We were told in our initial briefing
these warehouses were abandoned.
PARCHER: That's not precisely accurate.
PARCHER: By telling you this...
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.
Get it?
What operation?
Those are a good idea.
PARCHER: This factory is in Berlin,
we seized it at the end of the war.
The Soviets reached this facility
before we did, and we lost the damn thing.
The routing orders at the Pentagon.
They were about this, weren't they?
The Soviets aren't as unified
as people believe.
PARCHER: A faction of the Red Army
calling itself <i>Novaya Svoboda</i>...
has control of the bomb...
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.
PARCHER: Man is capable of as much atrocity
as he has imagination.
McCarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately,
that doesn't make him wrong.
and magazines...
I have ever seen.
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?
Commit this list of periodicals to memory.
PARCHER: Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes, decipher them.
DOCTOR: Place your chin on the chin rest.
DOCTOR: Stare into the light.
TECHNICIAN: Pulse 88, regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.
PARCHER: It's got a little zap to it,
doesn't it?
He just implanted a radium diode.
Don't worry, it's safe.
They're the access codes to your drop spot.
So what am I now, a spy?
JOHN: Come.
Boy, you must be really important.
It's all right, Mike.
What are you working on?
Classified.
Everyone waited half an hour.
JOHN: For?
ALICIA: Class.
Oh. I suspect that...
ALICIA: The problem
that you left on the board...
I never said that the vector fields
were rational functions.
Your solution is elegant.
Though on this particular occasion...
Why?
ALICIA: I'm wondering, Professor Nash...
You do eat, don't you?
On occasion, yeah.
Table for one.
Prometheus alone chained to the rock...
you know how it is.
No, I expect that you wouldn't know...
Leave your address with my office.
I'll pick you up Friday...
One more thing. Do you have a name,
or should I just keep calling you "miss"?
JOHN: Governor...
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Professor, please. You and the governor.
Wait, one second. I'm sorry.
ALICIA: I want a copy of this.
First big date and all, you know.
you find yourselves in altogether naturally.
There. Better.
Professor.
God must be a painter.
So you're a painter?
That's not actually what I said...
ALICIA: Here.
Me.
Your date.
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.
ALICIA: [Laughing] That's a plan.
Champagne would be lovely.
I will get the champagne.
ALICIA: Oh, thank you.
Thank you for that.
No, keep it.
I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.
I don't believe in luck.
But I do believe
in assigning value to things.
Oh.
ALICIA: I once tried to count them all.
I actually made it to 4,348.
You are exceptionally odd.
I bet you're very popular with the girls.
A pair of odd ducks, then.
Mmm.
Pick a shape.
What?
Pick a shape, an animal, anything.
Okay.
An umbrella.
Do it again.
Do it again.
JOHN: All right. What would you like?
ALICIA: Do an octopus.
ALICIA: You don't talk much, do you?
JOHN: I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.
I don't mean work.
I find that polishing my interactions...
requires a tremendous effort.
I have a tendency
to expedite information flow...
All right.
I find you attractive.
Your aggressive moves towards me
indicate that you feel the same way.
But still, ritual requires that we continue
with a number of platonic activities...
I am proceeding with those activities...
with you as soon as possible.
Are you going to slap me now?
How was that result?
MARCEE: What are you doing?
Trying to isolate patterned reoccurrences
within periodicals over time.
And you?
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.
Do I know you?
My uncle says you're very smart
but not very nice...
if you're mean to me.
And who might your uncle be?
CHARLES: The prodigal roommate...
JOHN: Come here, Charles.
My sister got herself killed in a car crash.
Not too far now, Marcee!
So, I took her in.
I'm at Harvard...
D.H. bloody Lawrence.
I really do think
you should buy yourself a new book.
CHARLES: Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.
How are you, John?
At first, all my work here was trivial...
I can't really tell you any details.
Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?
Something like that.
Well, I met a girl.
on a number of different levels.
God, that's wonderful.
There's no accounting for taste, is there?
I mean, everything's going well.
The job is fine. I have enough money.
It all seems to add up.
But how do you know for sure?
Nothing's ever for sure, John.
That's the only sure thing I do know.
WAITER: Good evening.
JOHN: Alicia, please don't be angry.
I just lost track of time at work...
JOHN: . . Again.
ALICIA: Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry.
I didn't have time to wrap it.
Happy birthday.
JOHN: The refractive faces of the glass
create a full wavelength dispersal...
ALICIA: Every possible color.
JOHN: Every possible color.
Yeah.
Remember you said that time, God must
be a painter because of all the colors?
At the governor's house you said that.
I didn't think you were listening.
I was listening.
It's beautiful.
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?
Because I need some kind of proof,
some kind of verifiable, empirical data.
I'm sorry, just give me a moment...
of romance.
A proof?
Verifiable data.
Okay.
Well, how big is the universe?
Infinite.
ALICIA: How do you know?
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?
I don't, I just believe it.
It's the same with love, I guess.
Now...
Smile for the camera!
Well done!
Congratulations.
WOMAN: You look beautiful.
SOL: Hi, how are you?
WOMAN: Bye-bye.
MAN: 'Bye, now.
CAMBRIDGE, MA - OCTOBER 1954
Get in. Hurry.
They're following us.
PARCHER: Get down!
Stay down.
PARCHER: Take this.
JOHN: I ain't shooting anybody.
PARCHER: You stay back. Don't move.
ALICIA: John?
Hi.
Where were you?
JOHN: Sol...
ALICIA: Yeah, I talked to Sol.
Why didn't you call me?
Are you all right?
ALICIA: Honey?
ALICIA: John...
Tell me what happened.
Come on, open the door! Let me in!
Talk to me!
John!
ALICIA: [Shouts] Open this door!
WOMAN: Watch for cars, kids.
PARCHER: John.
William.
Every time a car backfires or a door slams...
I understand better
than you could possibly imagine.
You need to calm down, John.
PARCHER: Now listen.
We're closing in on the bomb...
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?
William, my circumstance has changed.
Alicia's pregnant.
I told you attachments were dangerous.
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...
Well, I'll just quit.
You won't.
Why would I not?
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.
Parcher!
SOL: John, you all right?
ALICIA: John?
JOHN: [Angrily]
Turn it off! Turn off the light!
Why would you do that?
You have to go to your sister's.
JOHN: I left the car out in back.
Take Commonwealth, no side streets.
Stay where it's crowded.
ALICIA: John, I'm not going anywhere!
JOHN: When you get to your sister's,
wait for my call.
Stop! Stop it!
JOHN: Please, Alicia.
I'll explain when I can.
HARVARD UNIVERSITY
NATIONAL MATHEMATICS CONFERENCE
MARCEE: Uncle John!
Hey, baby girl! [Marcee giggles]
Wow, someone needed a hug!
I saw you on the slate,
and I thought to myself:
by the inimitable John Nash?"
CHARLES: What's wrong?
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.
Now you tell me, what is it?
WOMAN: Professor Nash!
Welcome!
After?
JOHN: So, we see that the zeroes
of the Riemann Zeta function...
Singularities in space-time then...
And conventional number theory...
It breaks down
in the face of relativistic exploration.
Sometimes our expectations
are betrayed by the numbers.
Variables are impossible
to assign any rational value.
MAN: Professor Nash!
MAN: Hold it!
ROSEN: Professor Nash?
ROSEN: Professor Nash,
let's avoid a scene, shall we?
What do you want?
My name is Rosen.
Dr. Rosen. I'm a psychiatrist.
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.
ROSEN: I'd like you
to come with me, John.
Just for a chat.
It appears I have no choice.
Help me! Somebody!
JOHN: [Screams] Somebody!
MAN: No, no, don't!
Charles, they're Russians!
They're Russians!
JOHN: They're Russians!
ROSEN: Steady the leg.
Get away from me.
JOHN: Stay away from me!
ROSEN: There, now.
All better.
ROSEN: Everything's all right here.
Watch your head.
ROSEN: [Faintly] <i>John? </i>
Go easy now.
You've got one hell of a right hook.
JOHN: [Weakly] Where am I?
MacArthur Psychiatric Hospital.
I find that highly unlikely.
JOHN: You made a mistake.
My work is non-military in application.
Which work is that, John?
I don't know anything.
There's no good in keeping secrets,
you know.
Charles?
JOHN: Charles?
I didn't mean to get you involved in this.
JOHN: I'm sorry.
Charles?
The prodigal roommate revealed.
You lying son of a bitch!
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.
How do you say
How do you say it in Russian?
ROSEN: There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.
He's right there. He's right there.
JOHN: Stop! I don't know anything!
Stop! I don't know anything!
My name is John Nash.
I'm being held against my will.
Somebody call the Department of Defense.
My name is John Nash.
I'm being held against my will!
ALICIA: What's wrong with him?
John has schizophrenia.
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.
But his work.
He deals with conspiracy.
Yes, I know.
ROSEN: In John's world,
these behaviors are accepted...
As such,
his illness may have gone untreated...
What do you mean? How long?
Possibly since graduate school.
At least that's when his hallucinations
seem to have begun.
What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?
One, so far, that I am aware of.
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.
Charles isn't imaginary.
They have been best friends
since Princeton.
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?
He's always in town
for so little time, lecturing.
Have you seen a picture,
or talked to him on the phone?
This is ridiculous.
I phoned Princeton.
According to their housing records,
John lived alone.
Now, which is more likely?
That your husband...
with no military training...
Or, that he has lost his grip on reality?
The only way I can help him,
is to show him the difference...
and what is in his mind.
Come on.
What's he been working on?
His work is classified.
He mentioned a supervisor...
Maybe Mr. Parcher
can clarify things for us.
You want me to help you get the details
of my husband's work?
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.
Is that what you think?
I don't know.
I want to see
what John's been working on.
Stop.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say something?
Alicia, John has always been...
He said he was doing code-breaking.
Was he?
It was possible.
Directives come down all the time
that some aren't cleared for.
Lately, he'd become much more agitated,
and then when you called...
So, is this all he's been doing every day?
Cutting up magazines?
Well, not all.
ALICIA: [Sobs] I'm so sorry.
JOHN: It's okay.
I missed you.
I have to talk to you.
ALICIA: Okay.
Alicia, I've been thinking about it...
to discuss the situation with you...
I left you with no other choice.
I do understand...
Everything will be all right.
Everything will be all right.
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.
I'll tell you everything now.
It's breaking with protocol,
but you need to know...
get out of here.
I've been doing top-secret work
for the government.
There's a threat that exists...
I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.
That's why they won't do away with me.
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me from doing my work.
You have to get to Wheeler.
JOHN: You have to find William Parcher.
ALICIA: Stop.
Stop!
I went to Wheeler.
Good, good.
There is no William Parcher.
Of course there is.
I've been working for him.
ALICIA: Doing what? Breaking codes?
Dropping packages in a secret mailbox
for the government to pick up?
How could you know that?
Sol followed you.
ALICIA: He thought it was harmless.
JOHN: Sol followed me?
ALICIA: They've never been opened.
It isn't real.
Do you understand, baby?
You're sick.
ALICIA: John?
ALICIA: [Sobs] John!
Code red.
John?
John?
The implant is gone.
I can't find it.
It's gone.
ROSEN: You see,
the nightmare of schizophrenia...
What kind of hell would that be?
NURSE 1: Administering insulin.
NURSE 2: 8:42 a.m.
ALICIA: How often?
ROSEN: Five times a week for 10 weeks.
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY - 1 YEAR LATER
ALICIA: John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.
SOL: So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.
ALICIA: [Chuckling] Yeah.
John won't come near the campus, though.
I think he's ashamed.
ALICIA: Hey. Hey.
SOL: So, Alicia, how are you holding up?
The delusions have passed.
They're saying with the medication
and low stress environment...
I mean, how are you?
I think often what I feel...
Or guilt over wanting to leave.
Rage against John, against God, and...
But...
that I married.
And he becomes that man.
He's transformed into someone that I love.
And I'm transformed into someone
who loves him.
It's not all the time, but...
I think John is a very lucky man, Alicia.
So unlucky.
ALICIA: This is us.
SOL: This is it?
ALICIA: It's near where I work.
ALICIA: [Brightly] John?
You have a visitor.
Hi.
ALICIA: [Softly] I hope it's okay.
Hey, chief.
I quit, actually.
Have you met Harvey?
There's no point being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.
SOL: [Laughs nervously] Jesus Christ.
I should have known.
Here you go.
ALICIA: Okay.
So, I was in town giving a workshop.
Bender really wanted to stop by...
Squeamish?
Yeah.
I suppose I would be, too.
But, alas, I'm stuck with me.
I'm trying to solve the Riemann hypothesis.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah?
JOHN: I figured if I dazzle them...
But it's difficult with the medication...
SOL: You know, John, you should go easy.
There are other things besides work.
What are they?
What are you thinking about?
What do people do?
It's life, John.
Activities available, just add meaning.
You could try leaving the house.
You know, maybe...
You could try taking out the garbage.
JOHN: [Muffled] And there's some more,
there's some more in...
Who were you talking to?
Garbage man.
Garbage men don't come at night.
I guess around here they do.
Sorry.
ALICIA: Is it the medication?
ALICIA: [Sobs] I don't know what to do.
ALICIA: My mother's going to
keep the baby a little longer tonight.
I'm going to bed.
PARCHER: It's good to see you, John.
Parcher?
Yes, sir.
You're not real!
Of course I am. Don't be ridiculous.
I don't think that I would go that way.
PARCHER: It's time for you
to get back to work.
We've narrowed the bomb's location
to somewhere on the eastern seaboard.
PARCHER: Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.
Look at this, John.
What?
What?
Psychological bullshit!
PARCHER: Look at me, John.
Do I look like I'm imagined?
Wheeler has no record of you.
Do you think we list our personnel?
PARCHER: I'm sorry you had to
go through all this.
I can restore your status at Wheeler.
I can let the world know what you did.
But I need you now, soldier.
I was so scared you weren't real.
Princeton, New Jersey - April 1956
ALICIA: There's a storm coming.
I'm just going to grab the laundry.
JOHN: I'll draw his bath.
It's okay.
Okay.
ALICIA: [Shouts] John!
JOHN: I've almost got it!
Charles, you just watch the baby.
No!
ALICIA: [Sobs] I need a towel.
There is no one here!
He's been injected with a cloaking serum.
I couldn't tell you,
it was for your own protection!
JOHN: Alicia!
PARCHER: You've got to stop her, John.
You leave her out of this.
PARCHER: She'll compromise us again.
NASH: She won't.
PARCHER: You'll go back to the hospital.
Alicia, please put the phone down.
Hi, I need Dr. Rosen. Is he in?
I'm sorry, John.
JOHN: No!
PARCHER: You know what you must do.
ALICIA: Get away from me.
I didn't mean to hurt you!
Finish her. She knows too much now.
MARCEE: Uncle John?
PARCHER: Take care of her, you pathetic
piece of shit, or I'll take care of you.
CHARLES: Christ, John,
please do what he says.
Move, soldier.
MARCEE: Uncle John?
CHARLES: John, please!
Now!
JOHN: [Voiceover] <i>Alicia and Charles never</i>
She never gets old.
Marcee can't be real. She never gets old.
You see them now?
Yes.
Why did you stop your meds?
Because I couldn't do my work.
I couldn't help with the baby.
I couldn't...
I couldn't respond to my wife.
You think that's better than being crazy?
We'll need to start you on a higher run
of insulin shocks and a new medication.
No.
JOHN: There has to be another way.
ROSEN: Schizophrenia is degenerative.
Some days may be symptom-free,
but over time, you are getting worse.
It's a problem. That's all it is.
It's a problem with no solution.
And that's what I do, I solve problems.
ROSEN: This isn't math.
Because your mind is where the problem is
in the first place.
I can do this.
I can work it out. All I need is time.
Is that the baby?
The baby is at my mother's, John.
ROSEN: Without treatment, John...
ALICIA: You almost ready?
Rosen's waiting outside.
I can't go back to that hospital.
I won't come home.
He said that if you said that...
for me to sign.
Well, maybe you won't sign them.
I will try to figure this out.
You shouldn't be here.
I'm not safe anymore.
Would you have hurt me, John?
I don't know.
ALICIA: He told me to leave.
ALICIA: I understand.
Rosen said to call if you try and kill me,
or anything.
You want to know what's real?
This.
This.
This is real.
Maybe the part...
Maybe it's here.
I need to believe...
Princeton University - Two Months Later
MARTIN: Come.
Hello, Martin.
Jesus Christ.
No. I...
I don't have that one. My savior complex
takes on a completely different form.
I heard what happened and...
and I tried you at MacArthur's...
This is Helinger's old office.
Yeah.
Yeah, I stole it from him.
Seems that you won after all, Martin.
They were wrong, John. No one wins.
Please, have a seat.
MARTIN: God, it's so good to see you.
CHARLES: John?
John, I'm sorry, but you have to tell him.
Tell him your work is critical.
John, please!
Is there any chance
that you could ignore what I just did?
Of course, what are old friends for?
Is that what we are, Martin? Friends?
John, of course.
Of course. We always have been.
Alicia and I think...
being part of a community...
That a certain level of attachment,
familiar places, familiar people...
It's a lot to ask, and now that I'm here...
that you will just say no.
But I was wondering if I could hang around.
Huh.
Will you be needing an office?
No.
No, I could just work out of the library.
MAN: This guy tries to wander into
the library...
MAN: . . But he has no ID.
MARTIN: Why can't people read memos?
Then he goes totally nuts.
JOHN: [Shouting outside]
You're not real! You're not real.
Oh, shit. Shit.
JOHN: You're not real! You are not real!
Is this what you are, soldier?
Some useless ghoul?
The local madman?
JOHN: I'm not a soldier.
PARCHER: You'll end up in a cell!
Old, worthless, discarded.
JOHN: There's no mission.
PARCHER: While you rock and drool,
the world will burn to ashes!
You are not real! You are not real!
You're still talking to me, soldier.
JOHN: There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!
MARTIN: John? John?
John! It's okay.
I just heard what happened, I'm sorry.
Nash, hey. You're all right.
Nash, hey.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!
John?
JOHN: <i>You should've seen their faces. </i>
Everybody was just staring at me.
John, you know that stress
triggers the delusions.
I know.
But then, on the way home...
Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.
Maybe I have to think about going back
into the hospital again.
ALICIA: No. Come here.
Maybe try again tomorrow.
John, now you can't ignore me forever.
You've been a very good friend to me.
But I won't talk to you again.
I just can't.
Same goes for you, baby girl.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
I was wondering
if I might audit your course.
It's an honor, Professor Nash.
Is something wrong?
This will be my first class.
Good morning...
It's never going to work, John.
You're just humiliating yourself.
It's pathetic!
You are being pathetic.
I'm ashamed of you!
STUDENT: [Laughing] Oh, man!
ALICIA: Are you coming?
You're going to be late.
Thanks.
See you tonight.
ALICIA: 'Bye, honey.
Princeton University - October 1978
Did you just solve Riemann?
Well, what do you think?
TOBY: That's an analog to Frobenius
for noncommutative extensions.
Yes, it is.
JOHN: But it only appears
to work sporadically, so, no.
But...
You're...
You're John Nash, right?
I've been studying your equilibrium
that you wrote here at Princeton.
You know, I was young.
I've been developing a theory.
I believe I can prove...
are covering spaces.
That everything is connected.
That it's all part of the same subject.
When was the last time you ate?
Oh, uh...
My wife...
Thank you.
Go on.
The functor...
MARTIN: Alicia!
Alicia!
JOHN: Coming together
at a maximum speed of...
and flies to the tire of bicycle "A"...
until the two bikes collide...
no matter what people here will tell you...
Don't listen to those people.
I was thinking that I might teach.
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.
John, besides, you're a terrible teacher.
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.
I was hoping there still might be
something I could contribute.
What about the...
Well, you know.
Are they gone?
No, they're not gone.
And maybe they never will be.
But I've gotten used to ignoring them,
and I think they've given up on me.
You think that's what it's like with
all our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?
You've got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?
MARTIN: John, they haunt you though.
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.
JOHN: Well, good-bye.
MARTIN: John, I'll talk to the department.
Maybe in the spring.
Hey, Nash.
You, uh...
You scared?
Terrified.
Mortified. Petrified.
Stupefied by you.
Now you ought best ring Alicia,
or you'll get me...
Princeton University - March 1994
Papers in hand, Mr. Bayer.
Professor Nash?
Positive? He's within your vision?
Forgive me,
I'm just always suspicious of new people.
So now that I know that you're real,
who are you, and what can I do for you?
Professor, my name is Thomas King.
Thomas King?
I'm here to tell you that you're being
considered for the Nobel Prize.
JOHN: Forgive me,
but I'm just a little stunned.
KING: Over the past years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone...
Suddenly everybody likes that one.
What about my work on other some
such projects like manifold embedding?
The application
of your bargaining problem...
or to antitrust cases...
I never would have considered that.
Have I just reached some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?
KING: [Laughs] No, you haven't.
JOHN: I wouldn't have thought of that.
Shall we have tea?
I don't go in there.
I usually take my sandwich in the library.
Come on, John. Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.
Most commercially available brands of tea
are not suitable to my palate.
I'm not...
There are some Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough...
I enjoy the flavor that they have.
I have not been in this room...
I wonder what tea they serve.
JOHN: Why, thank you, young lady.
Things have certainly changed around here.
I have a son that age.
Harvard.
JOHN: Hmm.
I would have thought the nominations
for the Nobel Prize would've been secret.
I would have thought you'd only find out
if you won or lost.
That is generally the case, yes,
but these are special circumstances.
The awards are substantial.
They require private funding as such...
I see, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?
Find out if I would screw everything up
if I actually won?
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk like a chicken?
Something like that, yes.
Would I embarrass you?
Yes, it is possible.
You see, I...
I am crazy.
I take the newer medications...
I just choose not to acknowledge them.
Like a diet of the mind,
I choose not to indulge certain appetites.
Like my appetite for patterns.
Perhaps my appetite to imagine
and to dream.
MAN: Professor Nash.
Thank you.
A privilege, Professor.
Professor.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ed.
That was certainly most unexpected.
Nobel Prize Ceremony - Stockholm, Sweden
December 1994
JOHN: <i>Thank you. </i>
JOHN: So nice to have met you.
I'll call for the car, Dad.
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
What is it? What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
JOHN: I have a car outside.
Are you interested in a ride?
ALICIA: Where's it going to?
Nash's theories have influenced
global trade negotiations,
national labor relations and
even breakthroughs in evolutionary biology.
John and Alicia Nash live in Princeton, NJ.
John keeps regular office hours
in the Mathematics Department.
He still walks to campus every day.
