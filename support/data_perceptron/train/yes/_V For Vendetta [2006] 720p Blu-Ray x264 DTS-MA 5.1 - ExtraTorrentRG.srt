WOMAN: Remember, remember
The 5th of November
The gunpowder treason and plot
I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot
But what of the man?
I know his name was Guy Fawkes...
to blow up the Houses of Parliament.
But who was he really?
What was he like?
WOMAN: We are told to remember
the idea and not the man.
Because a man can fail.
He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten.
But 400 years later...
I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas.
I've seen people kill
in the name of them...
But you cannot kiss an idea...
Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain.
They do not love.
And it is not an idea that I miss.
It is a man.
A man that made me remember
the 5th of November.
A man that I will never forget.
So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies...
containers filled with wheat and tobacco.
A gesture, they said, of goodwill.
You wanna know what I think?
Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do.
It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them.
I think it's payback time for a tea party
they threw us a few hundred years ago.
I say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap...
Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!
Who's with me?
Who's bloody with me?!
Did you like that?
U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.
I mean, what else can you say?
Here was a country that had everything,
absolutely everything...
The world's biggest leper colony. Why?
Godlessness.
Let me say that again.
Godlessness.
It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created.
It was Judgment.
No one escapes their past.
No one escapes Judgment.
You think he's not up there?
You think he's not watching over
this country?
How else can you explain it?
He tested us, but we came through.
We did what we had to do.
Islington. Enfield.
I was there. I saw it all.
Immigrants, Muslims...
Disease-ridden degenerates.
They had to go.
Strength through unity.
Unity through faith.
I am a God-fearing Englishman,
and I'm goddamn proud of it!
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.
Oh, shit.
WOMAN'S VOICE [OVER SPEAKER]:
A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.
Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.
This is for your protection.
A yellow-coded curfew
is now in effect.
Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest.
This is for your protection.
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.
MAN: See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.
You know what that means,
don't you?
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.
And you get to swallow it.
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.
Not yet you're not. But you will be.
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!
Help me! Someone help!
V: The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.
FINGERMAN: What the hell?!
WILLY: Bugger off!
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel...
FINGERMAN:
We're Fingermen, pal.
V:
Aha!
Jesus Christ! Mercy!
We are oft to blame in this--
and pious action...
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.
Who is but the form
following the function of what...
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.
the more commonplace sobriquet...
of this dramatis persona.
Voilà!
In view, a humble
vaudevillian veteran...
and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.
This visage,
no mere veneer of vanity...
now vacant, vanished.
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...
and voracious violation of volition.
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...
for the value and veracity of such...
and the virtuous.
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...
Are you, like, a crazy person?
I am quite sure they will say so.
But to whom, might I ask,
am I speaking?
E-vey. Of course you are.
and do not believe in coincidence.
Are you hurt?
No, I'm fine.
You see, I'm a musician of sorts...
a very special performance.
What kind of musician?
Percussion instruments
are my speciality.
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...
if you could join me.
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.
All right.
EVEY:
It's beautiful up here.
V: A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.
I don't see any instruments.
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...
to have taken from these parts...
that stands in her stead.
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?
Remember, remember
The 5th of November
The gunpowder treason and plot
I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot
First, the overture.
Yes.
Yes, the strings.
Listen carefully, can you hear it?
Now the brass.
I can hear it!
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!
Here comes the crescendo!
How beautiful, is it not?
Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.
The Bailey area is quarantined.
All significant witnesses
have been detained.
Good. Mr. Etheridge?
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
Add it to the blacklist.
I never want to hear that again.
Yes, sir.
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...
of conversation about the explosion.
Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?
We're calling it
an emergency demolition.
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.
Experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.
I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings...
to the edifice of a decadent past.
He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time...
that our conviction has rewarded us.
Mr. Heyer.
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...
retinal identification impossible.
We also managed to get a picture of
the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.
We located the fireworks launch...
of the explosives used at both sites.
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication...
with over-the-counter chemicals...
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.
Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.
Apologies, chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is a test.
Moments such as these
are matters of faith.
To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe...
Doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos, and I will not let that happen.
Gentlemen, I want this
terrorist found...
what terror really means.
England prevails.
ALL:
England prevails.
WOMAN: You think people will buy this?
DASCOMB: Why not?
This is the BTN.
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.
That's the government's job.
On the lighter side of things...
the demolition of the Old Bailey...
albeit improvised, sendoff.
Although the demolition had been
planned for some time...
according to the crew chief...
MAN [ON TV]: We'll be right back.
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.
I saw it, the whole thing.
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?
Evey, there you are.
I need two espressos and three coffees.
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.
MAN:
I don't get it.
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.
Maybe he's just getting started.
Yeah?
Okay. A lead on the girl.
MAN: Look, don't get me wrong,
I love it. A cow getting crucified.
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.
You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.
Gordon...
but there were Fingermen...
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.
Gotcha.
FRED: All that been x-rayed?
Nope. They're filled with bombs.
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?
FRED: What?
Laser Lass is banging.
What's all that?
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.
Must be Prothero.
I wish someone had the balls to tell that
brat this station ain't his playground.
What the hell is this?
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.
FINCH:
Juvenile Reclamation Project...
DOMINIC: Shit.
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.
You sure about that, sir?
I want a chance to talk to her...
into one of Creedy's black bags.
Who's that?
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.
Fucking hell.
MAN:
Come on, let's move!
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.
MAN'S VOICE [OVER SPEAKER]:
Attention. Attention.
Will all personnel please
evacuate the building.
This is not a drill.
Will all personnel evacuate the building.
What the hell's going on?
Dominic!
Police! Out of the way!
Get out the way!
Damn it!
I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know.
England prevails.
OFFICER: Sir.
Help, Storm, help!
MAN:
Don't touch it.
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?
V [ON TV]:
Good evening, London.
I do, like many of you, appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine...
the tranquility of repetition.
Bloody hell.
I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
But in the spirit of commemoration--
of the past...
with someone's death...
bloody struggle...
this November the 5th...
no longer remembered...
to sit down and have a little chat.
There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak.
Let me think, let me think.
Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones...
will soon be on their way.
Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation...
retain their power.
Words offer the means to meaning...
the enunciation of truth.
And the truth is...
with this country, isn't there?
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!
Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression.
And where once
you had the freedom to object...
coercing your conformity...
How did this happen?
Who's to blame?
Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others.
And they will be held accountable.
But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty...
I know why you did it.
I know you were afraid.
Who wouldn't be?
War, terror, disease.
There were a myriad of problems
which conspired...
and rob you of your common sense.
Fear got the best of you.
And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.
He promised you order,
he promised you peace...
was your silent, obedient consent.
Last night,
I destroyed the Old Bailey...
of what it has forgotten.
More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November...
His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom...
They are perspectives.
So if you've seen nothing...
remain unknown to you...
the 5th of November to pass unmarked.
But if you see what I see...
and if you would seek as I seek...
one year from tonight...
And together, we shall give them
a 5th of November...
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.
Cover the exits.
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.
Left.
You go right.
Spread out.
MAN 1:
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!
FINCH:
Hold your fire!
He put masks on all of us.
Jesus.
MAN 2: Don't shoot!
MAN 3: Wait!
MAN 4: Wait!
MAN 5: Hold your fire!
Freeze! Nobody move!
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!
MAN 6: Please hurry!
There's a bomb in the control booth.
Oh, no.
JONES: Yes, sir.
MARSHAL: Sir.
Everyone else, let's go.
Good God.
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!
Dascomb.
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?
MAN 1:
Wait, wait!
Don't shoot me, please!
It's him! It's him!
On your knees! On your knees!
MAN 2 [MUFFLED]:
Please! Please don't hurt me!
Here we go.
I did it.
Freeze!
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Aah!
We're interrupting your regular program
to bring you this terrifying report...
which ended only moments ago.
A psychotic terrorist,
identified only as the letter V...
high-powered explosives and weapons...
in order to broadcast a message of hate.
We've just received this footage
of a daring police raid.
OFFICER [ON TV]: Stop!
Stop, stay where you are, or we'll shoot!
Stay where you are!
Now, this is only an initial report...
that during this heroic raid...
Bollocks.
Again, from what we've been told
by authorities, the danger is now over.
The terrorist is dead.
FINCH:
Right there. What's he thinking?
Is he considering leaving her?
After she just saved him?
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.
Some part of him's human.
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.
PLAYING NEARBY]
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.
Stealing implies ownership.
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.
God, if they ever find this place....
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.
EVEY:
You mean, after what you've done.
God, what have I done?
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?
I must have been out of my mind.
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?
I think I should go.
They're looking for you.
If they know where you work,
they know where you live.
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:
Here, to my home.
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.
But I don't even know where this is.
You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.
Only until I'm done. After the 5th,
I no longer think it'll matter.
You mean a year from now?
I have to stay here for a year?
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.
You should've left me alone.
Why didn't you just leave me alone?!
They were interned at Belmarsh.
She died in a hunger strike. He died
when the military retook the shed.
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.
So we know her story.
Now we need his.
IPANEMA" PLAYING ON JUKEBOX]
V?
Ah. Bonjour, mademoiselle.
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.
Your hands.
Yes.
There, that's better.
I hope I didn't put you off
your appetite.
Can I ask what happened?
There was a fire. A long time ago.
Ancient history, for some.
Not really very good
table conversation.
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?
Mmm.
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.
Where did you get it?
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.
You're insane.
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...
I've always wanted to act.
Be in plays, movies.
When I was 9, I played Viola
in Twelfth Night. Mum was very proud.
Where is your mother now?
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
Can I ask about
what you said on the telly?
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?
There's no certainty, only opportunity.
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...
every one of them.
People should not be afraid
of their governments.
Governments should be afraid
of their people.
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.
Symbols are given power by people.
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...
can change the world.
I wish I believed that was possible.
Every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.
I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.
PROTHERO:
What is he?
PROTHERO [ON TV]:
A man does not wear a mask.
He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:
A goddamn coward!
There will be no negotiation.
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.
I'll tell you what I wish.
I wish I'd been there.
I wish I'd had the chance
for a face-to-face.
Just one chance, that's all I'd need.
This so-called V and his accomplice,
Evey Hammond...
spouting their message of hate.
A delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.
An ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice.
Good guys win, bad guys lose...
Holy Christ! Jesus!
Good evening, Commander Prothero.
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...
commander.
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.
You wore a uniform in those days.
You.
DASCOMB: Finch, it's Dascomb.
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...
to our credibility.
Perhaps a stroke?
No, no, it's too horrific.
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.
It's the same m.o. as before.
But we got an elevator log ID.
V?
My fat, metal friend.
Mondego.
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.
My favorite film:
The Count of Monte Cristo,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.
It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.
It gets me every time.
As only celluloid can deliver.
Okay.
Put the sword away.
Forensics just wrapped.
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...
the Voice of London?
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.
May we come up?
DANTES: You find your own tree.
V: You find your own tree.
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.
as news of the most popular--
Wait. What's this?
in the history of the BTN...
as "The Voice of London"...
from apparent heart failure.
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.
It came as no surprise
to those who knew him...
after everyone else had gone home.
Lewis, you will be sorely missed.
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.
You didn't take it, did you?
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?
Did you have anything
to do with that?
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.
Oh, I see.
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.
And are you going to kill more people?
Yes.
Take a look at this.
Prothero's military record.
What do you see?
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.
of a detention facility at Larkhill.
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...
north of Salisbury.
Well, there you have it.
This is a matter
of some urgency, major.
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records--
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.
As head of the Detention Program
at that--
Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.
We all did what we had to do.
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.
That's all I have to say about that.
You can do this.
Hi.
I've been thinking....
There's something
I want to ask you...
unless you know a few things about me.
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...
to cover the truth up.
A man after my own heart.
He always told the best stories.
Until my brother died.
That was when everything changed.
My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.
After he died,
my parents became political.
They protested the war
and the Reclamation.
When Sutler was appointed
high chancellor...
I watched on the television...
to see my parents killed.
I remember them arguing at night.
Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.
He said if we ran away,
they would win.
Win, like...
Evey, quick, hide!
EVEY'S MOTHER: Evey!
EVEY:
I never saw them again.
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.
I'm sorry, Evey.
No, I'm the one that's sorry.
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...
If you wish.
Do you really think
you'll find something here?
Worth a shot.
One thing is true of all governments:
The most reliable records
are tax records.
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.
Thanks. This is a great help.
V: "By the power of truth, l, while living,
have conquered the universe."
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?
It is. And speaking of the devil...
was still standing.
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.
I'll do my best.
I believe you will.
Another doctor. Why does a
detention facility need so many doctors?
I don't know, but this is interesting.
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.
Now, that is interesting.
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.
I've just received
your InterLink itinerary.
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.
You're most diligent, Denis...
who labor in the name of our Lord, but--
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.
My last little joy.
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.
Older?
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?
That is for Your Grace to decide.
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.
Mea culpa, my child.
Mea culpa.
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.
A confession?
I love the confessional game.
Tell me your sins.
This isn't a game, Your Grace.
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.
of protection or amnesty.
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm--
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.
I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.
Wonderful!
It's a game I've never played!
What a delightful mind you have.
I hope the rest of you
is just as interesting.
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.
Stop it! Get off of me!
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.
Now, how best to procure
her confession?
Oh!
You little bitch.
You fucking little whore!
V: Reverend.
She wasn't lying. It is you.
I'm sorry.
V: Evey!
And thus I clothe my naked villainy...
stolen forth from holy writ...
when most I play the devil.
Oh, please, have mercy.
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.
Not tonight.
LILLIMAN [OVER SPEAKER]:
Don't do this, I beg of you.
Well, then.
Children's hour at the abbey.
V: Open your mouth
and stick out your tongue.
LILLIMAN: I don't want to die!
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.
Creedy.
What are you doing here?
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.
The security of information
is paramount.
In these volatile times...
can no longer be tolerated...
Jordan Tower was an accident.
of our system.
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?
At this time, it would behoove you...
that have long since passed...
of our present.
You mean Larkhill?
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?
I've been a party member for 27 years.
If I were you, chief inspector...
Please.
Evey? Good God!
I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.
Evey, listen to me.
If the government searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.
You trusted me.
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.
Oh, my God.
That's God Save the Queen.
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...
But why would you keep it?
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.
Is it worth it?
If they found that here....
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.
Thank you, Gordon.
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.
I was on my way here, and....
Ah.
Yes.
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.
in the first place...
for less conventional fare.
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...
like yourself.
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...
without a home, let alone a TV show.
The truth is, after so many years...
more than just your appetite.
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.
Thanks, Delia.
DELIA:
Any leads on finding this guy?
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.
You started as a botanist, didn't you?
It's-- It's a Scarlet Carson.
They're believed to be extinct.
He leaves them at the crime scenes.
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.
Any information could be helpful.
Of course.
Excuse me.
Yeah?
DOMINIC: I just finished
going through the file, inspector.
You better get back here.
FINCH:
Yeah, okay.
FINCH: My God. He's killed them all.
DOMINIC: All but one.
FINCH: Who is she?
DOMINIC: Not sure.
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.
Running away?
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.
What? Are you sure about that?
Okay. Thank you.
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.
Jesus, I just saw her.
It's you, isn't it?
V: Yes.
Thank God.
OPERATOR: I'm sorry,
I can't get a response from that number.
There's a problem
with the connection.
Jesus Christ.
He's there.
DELIA: After what happened,
after what they did...
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.
I didn't know what
they were going to do.
I swear to you.
Read my journal.
What they did was only possible
because of you.
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.
He changed the entire course
of human history.
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.
I've come for what you did.
It's funny.
I was given one of your roses today.
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.
There are no coincidences, Delia.
Only the illusion of coincidence.
I have another rose.
And this one is for you.
Thank you.
Is it meaningless to apologize?
Never.
I'm so sorry.
Damn it.
FINCH: The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.
Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector?
The contents of this document
are a matter of national security...
of several important party members...
of the Articles of Allegiance.
As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified...
created by the terrorist...
fantasy of a former party member...
for psychological reasons.
Any discussion of this document
or its contents...
as an act of sedition...
You would do well, inspector...
DELIA:
May 23rd.
My first batch of subjects
arrived today...
that I'm very excited.
This could be the dawn of a new age.
Nuclear power is meaningless...
can kill an entire population...
GUARD 1: Stay together!
GUARD 2: Come on, move!
DELIA:
May 27th.
Commander Prothero toured the lab
with a priest, Father Lilliman...
for Rules and Rights violations.
It made me nervous, but the commander
assured me there wouldn't be a problem.
June 2nd.
I keep wondering if these people knew
how they might be helping their country...
They're so weak and pathetic.
They never look you in the eye.
I find myself hating them.
August the 18th.
Of the original four dozen,
over 75 percent are now deceased.
No controllable pattern
has yet emerged.
September the 18th.
There is one case that continues
to give me hope.
He exhibits none of the immune-system
pathologies the other subjects developed.
I've discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that I've been unable to categorize.
The mutations seem
to have triggered...
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.
The subject said
he could no longer remember...
Whoever he was,
he is now the key to our dream...
will not have been in vain.
November the 5th.
It started last night, around midnight.
The first explosions tore open
the entire medical section.
All my work, gone.
I was trying to understand how
it could've happened when I saw him.
The man from room 5.
He looked at me.
Not with eyes. There were no eyes.
But I know he was looking at me
because I felt it.
DELIA:
Oh, God...
PLAYING]
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
What is that you're making?
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.
I am V.
At last you know the truth.
You're stunned, I know.
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.
Viva la revolución.
That is not funny, Gordon.
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?
There is something wrong
with this country.
Morning, inspector.
You're at it early.
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.
I don't care if you answer me or not.
I just wanna say this aloud.
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.
Yeah, of course, inspector, but--
Because of the terrorist?
No.
So, what is it, chief?
What's going on?
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...
What if the worst...
in this country's history...
of religious extremists?
I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.
And they were executed. I know.
And maybe that's
really what happened.
But I see this chain of events...
and I have to ask:
What if that isn't what happened?
What if someone else
unleashed that virus?
What if someone else
killed all those people?
Would you really wanna know
who it was?
Sure.
Even if it was someone
working for this government?
That's my question.
If our own government
was responsible...
and Three Waters...
was responsible...
of almost 100,000 people...
MAN 1: This has to be the bloody
coldest March in years.
WOMAN: Keep talking like that,
we'll lose our party status.
MAN 2:
They're a pack of lying hypocrites!
MAN 1:
Keep it down, will you?
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...
believe the terrorist is still alive.
We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...
in all four quadrants.
SUTLER: Mr. Creedy?
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.
I want more than arrests.
I want results.
Celebrating what?
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.
DEITRICH [ON TV]: Very good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Listen, we've got an extraordinary
show for you tonight.
You're not gonna believe it.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.
Will you please give
a very warm welcome...
SAVE THE QUEEN" PLAYING ON TV]
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.
Oh, my God.
Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...
tremendous strain lately...
of this whole terrorism business...
to try and help you relax. Girls?
Ah! Warm milk.
There's nothing better.
I understand you enjoy a glass
every night, chancellor.
Since I was a boy.
But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.
DEITRICH: Oh, really?
Are you saying that he's not still alive
and active?
The terrorist has been neutralized.
Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!
The terrorist!
FAKE SUTLER:
The terrorist!
Get him!
Oh, dear.
FAKE SUTLER:
At last!
And now, for all the world to see.
It's him!
Unhand me! I am your chancellor!
How dare you! I am the chancellor!
Imposter!
Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!
What are they gonna do, fine us?
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.
Protect me.
I should've hired him
to be my mother.
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.
Gordon?
Quick, Evey, hide!
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?
MAN: Gotcha.
MAN: Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?
Please.
MAN: You've been charged
with three counts of murder...
conspiracy to commit terrorism...
for which is death by firing squad.
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...
If your information leads
to his capture...
from this facility immediately.
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?
You can return to your life,
Miss Hammond.
All you have to do is cooperate.
Process her.
WOMAN'S VOICE: I know there's
no way I can convince you...
but I don't care.
I am me.
My name is Valerie.
I don't think I'll live much longer.
I wanted to tell someone about my life.
This is the only autobiography
that I will ever write and, God...
I was born in Nottingham in 1985.
I don't remember much
of those early years...
My grandmother owned a farm
in Tottle Brook...
that God was in the rain.
I passed my 11 Plus
and went to girls' grammar.
It was at school
that I met my first girlfriend.
Her name was Sarah.
It was her wrists.
They were beautiful.
I thought we would
love each other forever.
I remember our teacher telling us...
that people outgrew.
Sarah did.
I didn't.
In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina.
That year I came out to my parents.
VALERIE: I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand.
My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.
VALERIE:
My mother said nothing.
But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?
Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have.
It is the very last inch of us.
But within that inch...
MAN:
It ends whenever you want it to.
VALERIE: I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life...
The Salt Flats.
It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career...
was how I met Ruth.
The first time we kissed...
any other lips but hers again.
We moved to a small flat
in London together.
She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box...
Those were the best years of my life.
VALERIE: But America's war
grew worse and worse...
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler...
passed with....
VALERIE:
After that, there were no roses anymore.
Not for anyone.
MAN:
You won't last much longer.
You're gonna die here.
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?
VALERIE: I remember how the meaning
of words began to change.
How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening...
I remember how "different"
became dangerous.
I still don't understand it...
VALERIE: They took Ruth
while she was out buying food.
I've never cried so hard in my life.
It wasn't long till they came for me.
It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place.
But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.
I shall die here.
Every inch of me shall perish.
Every inch...
An inch.
It is small, and it is fragile...
in the world worth having.
We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.
I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place.
I hope that the world turns
and that things get better.
But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean...
even though I do not know you...
I may never meet you...
With all my heart...
Valerie.
MAN:
I'm instructed to inform you...
by special tribunal...
to offer your cooperation...
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?
Escort Miss Hammond
back to her cell.
Arrange a detail of six men...
the chemical shed and shoot her.
MAN:
It's time.
I'm ready.
MAN: Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.
Just give them something, anything.
Thank you...
behind the chemical sheds.
MAN: Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.
What?
Hello, Evey.
You.
That wasn't real?
I thought they'd arrest him...
in his house, they had him executed.
Oh, God.
You did this to me?
You cut my hair?
You tortured me?
You tortured me.
Why?
You said you wanted to live without
fear. I wish there'd been an easier way...
I know you may never forgive me...
how hard it was for me.
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.
Every day, I wanted to end it.
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.
You're sick! You're evil!
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...
how to drink, how to breathe.
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.
But then something happened.
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.
Shut up! I don't want to hear
your lies!
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.
Yes, I created a lie.
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.
I can't feel anything anymore!
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.
I can't.... Can't breathe.
Asthma. When I was little--
Listen to me, Evey.
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.
They put you in a cell
and took everything they could take...
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...
You faced your death, Evey.
You were calm. You were still.
Try to feel now what you felt then.
Oh, God.
I felt....
Yes?
I'm dizzy.
I need air.
Please, I need to be outside.
There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.
AND THUNDER RUMBLING]
God is in the rain.
A REASON" PLAYING]
V.
I'm leaving.
There are 872 songs in here.
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.
I can't stay here.
I know.
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.
I thought about keeping this...
knowing you wrote it.
I didn't.
May I show you something
before you go?
She's beautiful.
She wrote the letter
just before she died.
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.
Then it really happened, didn't it?
And that's what this is all about.
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.
It's a basic principle of the universe...
an equal and opposing reaction.
Is that how you see it?
And they created a monster.
That would have scared me before...
Well....
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Evey...
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...
HEYER: Chancellor, I know no one
seems to want to discuss this...
for any eventuality...
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.
Now, it concludes that...
for the terrorist to use...
A separate report has been filed...
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...
Who filed that report?
HEYER:
Chief Inspector Finch.
Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?
No, sir. Just a feeling.
If I am sure of anything, inspector...
if it is to be subject to your feelings.
Mr. Dascomb,
what we need right now...
to the people of this country.
This message must be read
in every newspaper...
seen on every television.
This message must resound
throughout the entire InterLink!
I want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion.
I want every man, woman and child to
understand how close we are to chaos.
I want everyone...
In the former United States, civil war
continues to devastate the Midwest.
Scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years.
Ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise.
Police have arrested nine suspects....
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.
Outside the quarantine zone, a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.
Authorities uncovered new evidence
linking the terrorist organization called V...
on London 14 years ago.
DOMINIC: My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.
There were three men.
Covert intel.
Original black-baggers,
all under Creedy.
FINCH: Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.
The day after
the St. Mary's outbreak...
Keyes dies in a fire--
Rookwood goes missing.
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.
Rookwood.
How do I know that name?
DOMINIC: Shit. He must have had
a hidden trip on his file at the Finger.
But how'd he know it was you?
What do we do?
I'm a cop. I have to know.
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.
Still does.
That's close enough, inspector.
We're not wired.
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.
All the names and dates
are inside your head.
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.
A story can be true or false.
I leave such judgments to you,
inspector.
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...
up-and-coming politician.
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.
He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process.
The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry...
his supporters become.
Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.
At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons...
to its cost.
However, the true goal
of this project is power.
Complete and total
hegemonic domination.
The project, however, ends violently.
But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain...
from the blood of one of the victims.
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...
and you alone have the cure.
But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.
A man seemingly
without a conscience...
always justify the means.
He suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country...
Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:
A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.
Several hundred die
within the first few weeks.
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.
through the Underground.
ROOKWOOD: Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly...
the country until, at last...
Before the St. Mary's crises...
of the election that year. No one.
And then not long after the election,
lo and behold, a miracle.
Some believed it was the work
of God himself.
But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members...
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...
to canonize their victims.
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...
of high chancellor.
The rest, as they say, is history.
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.
I'm sure you would.
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing...
Till then, cheerio.
FINCH:
Rookwood...
come forward before?
What were you waiting for?
Well, for you, inspector.
I needed you.
V:
Shh, shh, shh....
PLAYING OVER SPEAKER]
What's he doing in the dark there?
Creepy Creedy.
Not sure I wanna know.
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?
And we both know why.
After I destroy Parliament...
someone else, some other piece of meat.
And who will that be?
You, Mr. Creedy.
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...
in every room of this house...
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.
You knew that one day
it'd be you or him.
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...
All you have to do is say the word.
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.
Why should I trust you?
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.
DANTES: It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.
May we come up?
You find your own tree.
DOMINIC: We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.
Still no word. What's he waiting for?
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.
MAN: Is that Chief Inspector Finch?
William Rookwood,
the one you're looking for.
I saw your report a couple weeks back,
thought I'd run it through our John Does.
I hooked him. Perfect dental match.
A floater. Fishermen picked him up.
No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.
Goddamn it!
That son of a bitch sat there...
and I ate it up!
So, what do we do now, inspector?
We do what we should
have been doing.
We find him.
Every day, gentlemen.
Every day that brings us closer
to November...
Three hundred and forty-seven days,
gentlemen.
Three hundred
and forty-seven failures!
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force--
We are being buried
beneath the avalanche...
I'll get it.
Bloody hell.
How many went out?
So far we count eight boxcars.
I want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested!
MAN: Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.
MAN: Anarchy in the UK!
Mr. Creedy, I am holding you
personally responsible for this situation.
FINCH: The problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves.
That's why I went to Larkhill
last night.
There wasn't much left.
But when I was there, it was strange.
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.
Like I could see the whole thing.
One long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before Larkhill.
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...
was going to happen.
FINGERMAN:
Hey, you!
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...
we were all a part of it...
So do you know
what's gonna happen?
No. It was a feeling.
But I can guess.
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.
And when they do...
Rioters were arrested in Brixton.
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.
And then....
BLACK TRAIN" PLAYING ON RADIO]
Tonight's your big night.
You ready for it?
Are we ready for it?
PLAYING ON JUKEBOX]
I missed this song.
I didn't think you'd come.
You look well.
Thank you.
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.
I must confess, every time
I heard a siren, I worried about you.
I worried about myself for a while.
But then, one day,
I was at a market...
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.
My friend picked it up...
She looked at me right in the eyes...
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.
I have a gift for you, Evey...
I'd like to ask you something.
Would you dance with me?
Now? On the eve of your revolution?
A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.
I'd love to.
Tonight, I will speak directly
to these people...
perfectly clear to them.
The security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance.
Tonight, any protestor,
any instigator or agitator...
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.
And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does--
If he does, and something happens
to that building...
the only difference it will make...
instead of a newspaper...
Mr. Creedy's resignation!
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.
It's nearly time.
The masks were ingenious.
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.
Conceal me what I am,
and be my aid...
shall become the form of my intent.
EVEY: Twelfth Night.
How you can be one of the most
important things that's happened to me...
almost nothing about you.
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...
I don't even know
what you really look like.
Evey, please.
There is a face beneath this mask...
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...
I understand.
Thank you.
There isn't much time.
I have something I must give you.
I went by Parliament.
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?
What usually happens
when people without guns...
Pull over here.
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?
Inspector.
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.
They did.
It took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.
Let me show you.
These tracks lead to Parliament.
Yes.
Then it's really going to happen,
isn't it?
It will if you want it to.
Everything that I have: my home,
my books, the gallery, this train...
what you will.
Is this another trick, V?
No. No more tricks. No more lies.
Only truth.
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...
is not mine to make.
that I helped shape, will end tonight.
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...
and this choice belongs to them.
Where are you going?
The time has come for me
to meet my maker...
for all that he's done.
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.
No. You were right about what I am.
I have no tree waiting for me.
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.
That's not true.
I can't.
My fellow Englishmen...
SWEEPER:
The area's clean, sir.
This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security...
Where is he?
Or unpunished.
V:
Penny for the Guy.
Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us...
of our great nation.
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?
Bring him down.
Tonight we must remain steadfast.
We must remain determined.
But most of all,
we must remain united.
Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew...
with our enemy...
without leniency or exception.
I want to see his face.
Tonight I give you
my most solemn vow...
Oh, God. No.
V:
At last, we finally meet.
I have something for you, chancellor.
A farewell gift.
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...
Goodbye, chancellor.
Mr. Creedy.
Disgusting.
Now that's done with...
at your face.
Take off your mask.
V:
No.
Defiant to the end, huh?
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.
You're like me.
The only thing you and I
have in common, Mr. Creedy...
How do you imagine
that's gonna happen?
With my hands around your neck.
Bollocks.
What are you gonna do, huh?
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.
We have guns.
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...
because if I am...
before you've reloaded.
That's impossible!
Kill him.
My turn.
Die! Die!
Why won't you die?!
Why won't you die?
Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.
And ideas are bulletproof.
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.
MAN:
This is General Ackroyd.
Keep communication tight.
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.
V!
Oh, God, we have to stop
your bleeding.
Please, don't.
I'm finished and glad of it.
Don't say that.
I told you, only truth.
For 20 years I sought only this day.
Nothing else existed...
Then everything changed.
I fell in love with you, Evey...
V, I don't want you to die.
That's the most beautiful thing...
V?
V?!
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.
Hold it. Stop right there.
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?
Then it's over?
Almost.
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.
No.
LIEUTENANT: Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.
Or from Party Leader Creedy.
Or from the high chancellor.
Why are you doing this?
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!
Jesus bloody Christ.
It's time.
Tell me...
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
That music?
Yes.
His music.
Who was he?
He was Edmond Dantes.
And he was my father...
My brother.
My friend.
He was you...
He was all of us.
EVEY:
No one will ever forget that night...
But I will never forget the man...
Governments should be afraid of their people.]
