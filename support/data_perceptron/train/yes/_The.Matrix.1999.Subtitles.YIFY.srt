I know, but I felt like taking a shift.
You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
Do you?
It doesn't matter what I believe.
You don't, do you?
Are you sure this line is clean?
Yeah, of course I'm sure.
I better go.
Do it! Do it now!
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.
I'm just doing my job.
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.
The orders were for your protection.
I think we can handle one little girl.
I sent two units!
They're bringing her down now!
No, lieutenant, your men
are already dead.
Shit.
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.
I know. They cut the hard line.
There's no time.
Get to another exit.
Goddamn it.
You have to focus, Trinity.
There's a phone at Wells and Lake.
You can make it.
That's impossible.
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.
Get up.
She got out.
It doesn't matter.
We have the name of their next target.
The name is Neo.
We'll need a search running.
It has already begun.
What?
What the hell?
Who is it?
It's Choi.
Yeah. Yeah.
You're two hours late.
I know. It's her fault.
You got the money?
Two grand.
Hold on.
Hallelujah.
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.
You get caught using that ... .
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.
You look a little whiter than usual.
My computer, it ... .
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
All the time.
It's called mescaline.
It's the only way to fly.
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.
Get some R and R?
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?
Definitely.
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.
Come on.
It'll be fun. I promise.
Yeah.
Sure. I'll go.
Hello, Neo.
How do you know that name?
I know a lot about you.
Trinity.
The Trinity?
That cracked the lRS D-base?
That was a long time ago.
I just thought ... 
Most guys do.
That was you on my computer.
How did you do that?
Right now, all I can tell you ... 
They're watching you, Neo.
I know why you're here, Neo.
I know what you've been doing.
I know why you hardly sleep ... 
night after night ... 
You're looking for him.
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.
And when he found me ... 
looking for him ... 
It's the question that drives us, Neo.
It's the question
that brought you here.
You know the question ... 
What is the Matrix?
The answer is out there, Neo.
It's looking for you.
And it will find you ... 
Shit.
Shit, shit.
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.
Obviously, you are mistaken.
This is one of the top
software companies in the world ... 
they are part of a whole.
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth ... 
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.
Thomas Anderson?
Yeah, that's me.
Okay.
Great.
Have a nice day.
Hello?
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?
I've been looking for you.
I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.
But unfortunately, you and l
have run out of time.
They're coming for you, and I don't know
what they're going to do.
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
What? Right now?
Yes. Now.
Do it slowly.
The elevator.
What do they want?
I don't know. If you don't want
to find out, get out of there.
How?
I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.
Stay here for just a moment.
When I tell you,
go to the end of the row ... 
at the end of the hall.
Stay as low as you can.
Go. Now.
Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.
To your left there's a window.
Go to it.
Open it.
Take the scaffold to the roof.
No way! No way!
This is crazy!
There are two ways
out of this building.
One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.
This is insane!
Why is this happening to me?
What'd I do?
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna die.
Shit!
Oh, shit!
I can't do this.
Shit.
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
It seems that you've been living ... 
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson ... 
a respectable software company.
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.
And you ... 
carry out her garbage.
The other life is lived in computers ... 
the hacker alias "Neo" ... 
computer crime we have a law for.
One of these lives ... 
And one of them does not.
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
You're here ... 
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain ... 
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.
He is considered by many authorities ... 
My colleagues ... 
my time with you.
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.
We're willing to wipe the slate clean ... 
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation ... 
a known terrorist to justice.
Yeah.
That sounds like a really good deal.
But I got a better one.
How about ... 
Mr. Anderson ... 
You can't scare me
with this Gestapo crap.
I know my rights.
I want my phone call.
Tell me, Mr. Anderson ... 
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson ... 
This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.
They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.
If they knew what I know ... 
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?
You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years ... 
my entire life ... 
Now, do you still want to meet?
Get in.
What's this?
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.
Stop the car.
Listen, coppertop.
We don't have time for 20 Questions.
Right now, there's only one rule:
Our way ... 
Fine.
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
You know that road.
You know exactly where it ends.
And I know that's
not where you want to be.
Apoc, lights.
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.
Try and relax.
Come on.
It's on the move.
Come on, you shit.
Clear!
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?
This is it.
Let me give you one piece of advice.
Be honest.
He knows more than you can imagine.
At last.
Welcome, Neo.
As you no doubt have guessed ... 
It's an honor to meet you.
No ... 
Please, come. Sit.
I imagine ... 
a bit like Alice ... 
You could say that.
I can see it in your eyes.
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees ... 
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.
Do you believe in fate, Neo?
No.
Why not?
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean.
Let me tell you why you're here.
You know something.
What you know,
you can't explain.
But you feel it.
You felt it your entire life:
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.
Like a splinter in your mind ... 
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.
Do you know what
I'm talking about?
The Matrix?
Do you want to know ... 
The Matrix is everywhere.
It is all around us.
Even now, in this very room.
You can see it when you
look out your window ... 
You can feel it when you go to work ... 
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes ... 
What truth?
That you are a slave.
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage ... 
smell or taste or touch.
A prison ... 
Unfortunately, no one can be ... 
You have to see it for yourself.
This is your last chance.
After this, there is no turning back.
You take the blue pill ... 
in your bed and believe ... 
You take the red pill ... 
the rabbit hole goes.
Remember ... 
Nothing more.
Follow me.
Apoc, are we on-line?
Almost.
Time is always against us.
Please take a seat there.
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.
What does that mean?
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy ... 
Did you ... ?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?
How would you know the difference
between the dream world ... 
This can't be.
Be what?
Be real?
Still nothing.
It's cold.
It's cold!
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
Targeting almost there.
He's going into arrest.
Welcome ... 
We've done it, Trinity.
We found him.
I know it.
Am I dead?
Far from it.
He still needs a lot of work.
What are you doing?
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.
Why do my eyes hurt?
You've never used them before.
Rest, Neo.
The answers are coming.
Morpheus, what's happened to me?
What is this place?
More important than "what" is "when."
You believe it's the year 1999 ... 
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is ... 
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.
Come with me.
See for yourself.
This is my ship.
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.
This is the main deck.
This is the core ... 
and hack into the Matrix.
Most of my crew you already know.
This is Apoc ... 
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
The little one behind you is Mouse.
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?
Trinity.
Try to relax.
This will feel a little weird.
This ... 
It's our loading program.
We can load anything, from clothing ... 
Right now we're inside
a computer program?
Is it really so hard to believe?
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.
Your hair has changed.
Your appearance now is what we call
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.
This isn't real?
What is "real"?
How do you define "real"?
If you're talking about
what you can feel ... 
signals interpreted by your brain.
This is the world that you know.
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation ... 
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.
This is the world ... 
Welcome to "the desert ... 
We have only bits and pieces
of information.
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century ... 
in celebration.
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.
Al.
You mean artificial intelligence.
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.
They were dependent on solar power ... 
they would be unable to survive ... 
as abundant as the sun.
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-voIt battery.
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
Combined with a form of fusion ... 
they would ever need.
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields ... 
are no longer born.
We are grown.
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes ... 
to the living.
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision ... 
the obviousness of the truth.
What is the Matrix?
Control.
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world ... 
No.
I don't believe it.
It's not possible.
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.
Stop!
Let me out!
Let me out! I want out!
Get this thing out of me!
Don't touch me!
Stay away from me!
I don't believe it.
Just breathe.
I can't go back, can I?
No.
But if you could ... 
I owe you an apology.
We have a rule.
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.
It's dangerous.
The mind has trouble letting go.
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
I did what I did because ... 
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside ... 
to change whatever he wanted ... 
It was he who freed the first of us ... 
As long as the Matrix exists ... 
After he died ... 
the destruction of the Matrix ... 
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix ... 
I did what I did because ... 
Get some rest.
You're going to need it.
For what?
Your training.
Morning. Did you sleep?
You will tonight.
I guarantee it.
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.
Born free right here ... 
Genuine child of Zion.
It's a city?
The last human city.
The only place we have left.
Where is it?
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.
You live long enough,
you might see it.
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of ... 
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but ... 
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.
How about ... 
I'm going to learn jujitsu?
Holy shit!
How about some more?
Hell, yes.
Hell, yeah.
How is he?
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.
I know kung fu.
Show me.
This is a sparring program ... 
of the Matrix.
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.
Some of them can be bent.
Others can be broken.
Understand?
Then hit me ... 
Good!
Adaptation.
Improvisation.
But your weakness ... 
Morpheus is fighting Neo.
How did I beat you?
You're too fast.
Do you believe that ... 
with my muscles in this place?
You think you're breathing air?
Again!
Jesus Christ, he's fast!
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.
What are you waiting for?
You're faster than this.
Don't think you are.
Know you are.
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!
I don't believe it.
I know what you're trying to do.
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
But I can only show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Tank, load the jump program.
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear ... 
Free your mind.
Whoa.
Okey-dokey.
Free my mind.
What if he makes it?
Come on.
All right.
No problem. Free my mind.
Free my mind. No problem. Right.
What does that mean?
It doesn't mean anything.
Everybody falls the first time.
Right, Trin?
If you're killed in the Matrix ... 
The body cannot live without the mind.
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.
There is something about him,
isn't there?
You're a believer now?
I keep wondering ... 
why not take him to see the Oracle?
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.
The Matrix is a system, Neo.
That system is our enemy.
But when you're inside,
what do you see?
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system ... 
You have to understand ... 
ready to be unplugged.
And many of them are so inert ... 
on the system ... 
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?
Freeze it.
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged ... 
Inside the Matrix ... 
We have survived by hiding
and running from them ... 
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.
Someone?
I won't lie to you, Neo.
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.
Why?
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.
Because of that ... 
or as fast as you can be.
What are you telling me?
That I can dodge bullets?
No, Neo.
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready ... 
We got trouble.
Shit.
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.
Search and destroy.
Set her down there.
How are we doing, Tank?
Power off-line.
EMP armed ... 
Electromagnetic pulse.
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.
Sewers.
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.
Now these sewers are
all that's left.
Quiet.
Whoa! Neo.
You scared the bejesus out of me.
Is that ... ?
The Matrix?
Yeah.
The image translators work
for the construct program.
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
Do you ... 
Sure.
You know ... 
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?
Good shit, huh?
Dozer makes it.
It's good for two things:
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.
So can I ask you something?
Did he tell you why he did it?
Why you're here?
Jesus!
What a mind job.
So you're here to save the world.
What do you say
to something like that?
A little piece of advice.
You see an agent ... 
Run.
You run your ass off.
Thanks for the drink.
Sweet dreams.
You know ... 
I know that when I put it
in my mouth ... 
that it is ... 
After nine years ... 
Ignorance is bliss.
Then we have a deal.
I don't want to remember nothing.
Nothing. You understand?
And I want to be rich.
You know, someone important.
Like an actor.
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
Okay.
You get my body
back in a power plant ... 
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
No. I told you, I don't know them.
I can get you the man who does.
Morpheus.
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.
Or a bowl of snot.
You know what it reminds me of?
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?
No, but technically,
neither did you.
That's exactly my point. Exactly.
Because you have to wonder ... 
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
Maybe they got it wrong.
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like ... 
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like ... 
like everything.
It's a single-celled protein ... 
vitamins and minerals.
Everything the body needs.
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.
You know, I wrote that program.
Here it comes.
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.
She doesn't talk very much ... 
I can arrange a more personal milieu.
The digital pimp hard at work.
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.
To deny our own impulses ... 
that makes us human.
Dozer, when you're done ... 
We're going in.
I'm taking Neo to see her.
See who?
The Oracle.
Everyone please observe ... 
and "no smoking" signs are on.
Sit back and enjoy your flight.
We're in.
We'll be back in an hour.
Unbelievable ... 
I used to eat there.
Really good noodles.
I have these memories from my life.
None of them happened.
What does that mean?
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.
But an oracle can?
That's different.
Did you go to her?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
She told me ... .
What?
We're here.
Neo, come with me.
So is this the same oracle
that made ... 
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.
And she knows what? Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
And she's never wrong.
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.
She is a guide, Neo.
She can help you to find the path.
She helped you?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
I told you I can only
show you the door.
You have to walk through it.
Hello, Neo.
You're right on time.
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.
These are the other Potentials.
You can wait here.
Do not try and bend the spoon.
That's impossible.
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.
What truth?
There is no spoon.
There is no spoon?
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.
The Oracle will you see now.
I know you're Neo.
Be right with you.
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?
Almost done.
Smell good, don't they?
Yeah.
I'd ask you to sit down ... 
That vase.
I'm sorry.
I said, don't worry about it.
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
How did you know?
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is ... 
if I hadn't said anything?
You're cuter than I thought.
I can see why she likes you.
Who?
Not too bright, though.
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.
So ... 
Do you think you are the One?
I don't know.
You know what that means?
It's Latin.
Means, "Know thyself."
I'll let you in on a little secret.
Being the One is just
like being in love.
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it ... 
Balls to bones.
Well ... 
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
Okay ... .
Now I'm supposed to say,
Then you say:
But what?
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.
You got the gift ... 
you're waiting for something.
What?
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
That's the way these things go.
He almost had me convinced.
I know.
Poor Morpheus.
Without him, we're lost.
What do you mean, "without him"?
Are you sure you want
to hear this?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
And no one, not you, not even me ... 
He believes it so blindly ... 
his life to save yours.
What?
You're going to
have to make a choice.
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.
One of you is going to die.
Which one will be up to you.
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
You have a good soul.
And I hate giving
good people bad news.
Don't worry about it.
As soon as you
step outside that door ... 
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.
You're in control of your own life.
Remember?
Here ... 
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it ... 
What was said ... 
They're on the way.
What is that?
Oh, déjà vu.
What did you just say?
Nothing.
Just déjà vu.
A black cat went past us ... 
Was it the same cat?
What is it?
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.
Oh, my God.
Let's go.
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!
Oh, no.
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.
Be calm. Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
Operator.
Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.
Eighth floor.
They're on the eighth floor.
Switch, straight ahead.
Neo ... .
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.
Now left. That's it.
Good.
Where are they?
They're in the walls.
In the walls!
It's an agent!
Morpheus!
You must get Neo out!
He's all that matters!
Go!
Cypher, come on!
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.
And you are?
A Smith.
Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Take him.
No!
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.
All of a sudden, boom.
Somebody up there still likes me.
I got you.
Just get me out of here fast.
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.
Right.
Is Morpheus alive?
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
Yes. They're moving him.
I don't know where.
He's alive. We need an exit.
You're not far from Cypher.
Got him.
Where are they?
Making the call.
Good.
You first.
Shit!
Tank!
No!
I don't know. It just went dead.
Hello, Trinity.
Cypher? Where's Tank?
You know ... 
I used to dream about you.
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.
Too bad things had to
turn out this way.
You killed them.
I'm tired, Trinity.
I'm tired of this war ... 
I'm tired of this ship ... 
the same goddamn goop every day.
But most of all ... 
and all of his bullshit.
Surprise, asshole!
I bet you never saw this coming ... 
God, I wish I could be there ... 
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens ... 
You gave them Morpheus.
He lied to us, Trinity.
He tricked us!
If you had told us the truth ... 
that red pill up your ass!
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.
All I do is what he tells me to do.
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix ... 
The Matrix isn't real.
I disagree, Trinity.
I think the Matrix ... 
All I do is pull the plug here.
But there ... 
Trinity.
They'll reinsert my body.
I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won't remember a thing.
By the way ... 
to say to Switch ... 
Not like this.
Too late.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Don't hate me, Trinity.
I'm just a messenger.
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.
If Morpheus was right ... 
I can pull this plug.
If Neo's the One ... 
Right?
I mean, how can he be the One ... 
You never did answer me before ... 
Morpheus' bullshit.
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.
Look into his eyes ... 
I don't believe it.
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!
You first.
Dozer?
Have you ever stood and stared at it?
Marveled at its beauty ... 
Billions of people ... 
Oblivious.
Did you know that the first Matrix ... 
human world where none suffered ... 
It was a disaster.
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.
Some believe that ... 
to describe your perfect world.
But I believe that ... 
their reality through misery ... 
So the perfect world was a dream ... 
kept trying to wake up from.
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.
The peak ... 
I say, "your civilization" ... 
for you, it became our civilization ... 
what this is all about.
Evolution, Morpheus.
Evolution.
Like the dinosaur.
Look out that window.
You had your time.
The future is our world, Morpheus.
The future is our time.
There could be a problem.
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.
How much time?
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack ... 
will change from this to this.
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.
What do they want?
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe ... 
We can't let that happen.
Trinity, Zion's more important than me ... 
There has to be
something we can do.
There is. We pull the plug.
You're going to kill him?
Kill Morpheus?
We don't have a choice.
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.
If the insider has failed ... 
as soon as possible, unless --
They're dead. In either case --
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.
Immediately.
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.
You were a father.
We'll miss you always.
Stop!
I don't believe this is happening.
I don't know.
The Oracle.
She told me this would happen.
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.
What choice?
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.
There is no way
that you're going back in.
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.
What?
I'm not the One, Trinity.
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.
No, Neo, that's not true.
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.
That's what it looks like ... 
I can't explain to you why it's not.
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.
What?
I believe I can bring him back.
Let me tell you what I believe.
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.
And since I am the ranking officer ... 
I believe you can go to hell.
Because you aren't going anywhere else.
Tank ... 
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had ... 
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species ... 
Every mammal on this planet ... 
with the surrounding environment.
But you humans do not.
You move to an area
and you multiply ... 
natural resource is consumed.
The only way you can survive ... 
There is another organism
on this planet ... 
Do you know what it is?
A virus.
Human beings are a disease.
A cancer of this planet.
You are a plague.
And we ... 
Okay, so what do you need?
Besides a miracle.
Guns.
Lots of guns.
Neo ... .
No one has ever done
anything like this.
That's why it's going to work.
Why isn't the serum working?
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.
Leave me with him.
Now.
Hold on, Morpheus.
They're coming for you.
They're coming.
Can you hear me, Morpheus?
I'm going to be honest ... 
I ... 
whatever you want to call it.
I can't stand it any longer.
It's the smell.
If there is such a thing.
I feel saturated by it.
I can ... 
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.
It's repulsive.
Isn't it?
I must get out of here.
I must get free.
And in this mind is the key.
My key.
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.
Do you understand?
I need the codes.
I have to get inside Zion ... 
You're going to tell me ... 
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
Holy shit!
Backup. Send backup.
Freeze!
What were you doing?
He doesn't know.
Know what?
I think they're trying to save him.
There is no spoon.
Find them and destroy them!
We're under attack!
Trinity!
Help!
Only human.
Dodge this.
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.
It wasn't fast enough.
Can you fly that thing?
Not yet.
Operator.
I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.
Hurry.
Let's go.
No.
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.
He's not going to make it.
Got you.
Trinity!
I knew it.
He's the One.
Do you believe it now, Trinity?
Morpheus ... .
The Oracle.
That's all.
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did ... 
between knowing the path ... 
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.
Order the strike.
They're not out yet.
You first, Morpheus.
Neo, I want to tell you something ... 
what it could mean if I do.
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.
Everything but this.
But what?
Neo!
Mr. Anderson.
Run, Neo. Run.
What is he doing?
He's beginning to believe.
You're empty.
So are you.
I'm going to enjoy watching you die ... 
Jesus, he's killing him.
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
That is the sound of inevitability.
It is the sound of your death.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
My name ... 
Oh, shit.
Sentinels.
Tank, charge the EMP.
He's gonna make it.
Flat or pumps? No, just --
What the shit? That's my phone!
That guy took my phone!
Got him!
He's on the run.
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!
I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.
Oh, shit!
Help! Need a little help!
The door.
The door on your left.
Your other left!
The back door.
Oh, no.
Here they come.
He's going to make it.
The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.
They're inside.
Hurry, Neo.
It can't be.
Check him.
He's gone.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
Neo ... .
I'm not afraid anymore.
The Oracle told me ... 
the man I loved would be the One.
So you see ... 
You can't be ... 
You hear me?
I love you.
Now, get up.
No.
How?
He is the One.
Neo!
I know you're out there.
I can feel you now.
I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.
You're afraid of change.
I don't know the future.
I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.
I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.
I'll hang up this phone.
And then I'll show these people
what you don't want them to see.
I'm going to show them a world ... 
A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.
A world where anything is possible.
Where we go from there ...
