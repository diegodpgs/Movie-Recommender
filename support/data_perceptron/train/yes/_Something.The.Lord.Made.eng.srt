Thank you.
All right, everybody. That's it for today.
Be sure you get that drop cloth up
before you leave, all right?
I like the sound of that! Yes, sir!
I broke this down
and I'm gonna leave it like that.
You make sure you get to heaven.
Yeah, your daddy taught you right.
When all the construction comes back, you got
skills to make something of yourself.
Thank you, sir.
That's fine. I can wait till payday.
I'm sorry.
All the others have families to feed.
But you do good work.
You got a funny way of telling me that.
Morning.
Thank you. You're a good man.
Why would a doctor
want to hire a carpenter?
Because it ain't nothing
but scud work anyway.
You ain't gonna like it.
Dr Blalock, this is Vivien Thomas.
Vivien? That's a girl's name.
Yes, my mother was so sure
she was having a girl
that she picked the name early, and kept it.
You don't say.
And tell this good doctor that his theories are
interesting and I'll pray for him.
Keep up, son.
Medical research.
We push the limits of surgery
using stray dogs
we get from the local dog catch.
They're darling but don't get too attached.
They're a means to a great end.
The dog pens get cleaned out twice a day.
I need the lab swept every morning.
Simple tasks, but they proved
beyond the abilities of your predecessors.
Can you handle it?
Don't "so what" me. Did you get it?
You got it. You must have got it.
I'm so glad.
Everyone's gonna see how smart you are.
I don't know
how smart you have to be to shovel up.
The guy I'm working for, he seemed
kind of eccentric, but he is a doctor, yeah.
That's right, he is a doctor.
So you just keep your eyes open.
Do everything just like we laid it out.
Doctor...
and Mrs Thomas.
Planning on going
to Tennessee State next year
to study medicine, be a doctor.
Unusual ambition for a carpenter.
I always wanted to be one since I was a kid.
I almost saved up enough money
for college and then the slowdown hit.
Those are Van Slyke-Neill gas manometers
over there. You can handle a saw?
For cutting the lines, my father
would measure on the lumber.
Call me Doctor.
So your daddy's a carpenter, too?
Those apparatus on the workbench.
What are they called?
Van Slyke-Neill gas manometers, sir, Doctor.
They are, indeed.
The Vanderbilt may be
a podunk institution,
but I'm gonna put it on the medical map.
I'm working on traumatic shock.
Damn thing kills thousands of people
every year,
and doctors don't know
what the hell to do about it.
Let me see those hands.
Pick that up.
Now the left hand.
Good.
Excuse me, Vivien.
Dr Blalock wanted you to have this.
You know what my grandfather did?
It has nothing to do
with me going out on strike.
Do you know what my grandfather did?
Yes.
He picked cotton in Mississippi.
You told me a hundred times.
My grandfather was a piece of property.
No better than that chair or table
over there.
His son became a free man
at the age of 15.
He raised me with hardly an elementary school
education.
Now I see my son graduate college
and go on to teach school.
So don't tell me
things don't get better over time.
Things don't just get better. People got
to change things, Pop. Make them better.
If I don't do something, I'll be a dead man
before I get paid like white teachers do.
Vivien, you know I'm right about this.
All right, now, Harold, just hold your head.
I got reading to do.
To anaesthetise Brutus,
first we have to calculate the weight.
He weighs 18.4 kilograms.
And it should take
to anaesthetise him for three hours
if the absorption rate is uniform.
Dogs? What kind of doctor is he?
When you practise on dogs,
then you can help heal people.
You look inside, you see all the colours,
all the pinks and blues, reds.
It's beautiful, Clara.
That's where life comes from.
What's this?
Open up.
Open up.
Open up, it's 10:00. I got to get to work.
Let's go. We'll come back later.
No. Something's wrong. It can't be closed.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir. Hello.
Sir, that's all my savings!
I had my money for school in there.
They got my money in there.
Gone?
We'll all just have to start over.
Took me seven years to save that money.
You're not the only one
who had money in that bank.
It's done! It's over with!
That's all poor people ever have
is each other.
There's no cut down the cannula, the femoral
vein. I showed you how to do it.
I figured out a way
to give it barbital intravenously.
The manometer?
It's all set up, Doctor.
Good.
If I say you're ready, you're ready.
I'll mark out the line and you cut along it.
Just like you did for your old daddy.
Why are we making the incision here?
It's the artery leading to the lungs
from the right side of the heart.
Not bad.
Now the rib spreader.
And why are we gonna damage
poor Brutus' greater vessels?
To induce traumatic shock to study it.
Watch this manometer.
And imagine that Brutus
is a 16-year-old boy,
just fell out of a tree saving his mum's cat.
He's broken four ribs, he's concussed.
Dad's rushed him to ER.
But he's gone into shock.
His blood pressure's way down.
His vital signs almost nonexistent.
Can we save him?
Not if I use present methods of treatment.
Conventional wisdom says
I should constrict the vessels.
I beg to differ. Let's break their rules.
Use my rules.
Body needs blood.
Let's give it some.
How's that gauge?
It's still falling.
Maybe the experts are right.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I'll kill this boy
and break his mother's heart.
It's rising.
That's life coming back.
Very good, Doctor.
Let's look at the record of our work.
The smoked drums.
That's a smoked drum.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I record all the information I need
on a smoked drum.
God damn it!
I have to do everything myself.
A whole day's work goes down the toilet,
and I have to start all over again.
Do you have sawdust
or just plain shit for brains?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Fine, get out of here.
Oh, Jesus.
My apologies. I'm sorry I lost my temper.
Normally it takes assistants months
to learn what you picked up in days.
It won't happen again.
Please.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Fellas, take the music down, will you?
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
I mentioned to General Cunningham
how proud we were that Al had chosen us
over all the medical schools in the country.
John, why don't you tell us what you said?
Be glad to, Walter.
I just got back from a month at the front.
There are thousands of our boys
in field hospitals
all over North Africa and ltaly
who owe their lives to Dr Blalock's work
in the treatment of shock.
I want everyone here to know
how grateful we are to him
and how proud you all should be.
Hear, hear.
Thanks, General.
It's great to have you here, Al.
But truth be told, it's Mary we really want.
Our new Chairman
of the Department of Surgery,
my old and dear friend, Dr Alfred Blalock.
Thank you, Walter.
Mary and I welcome you all to our home.
As do our dear children.
Thank you, Johns Hopkins,
for my prodigal return
after 15 years in the Tennessee backwoods.
To find myself back here...
Dreams do come true.
You're the best surgeons in the country
and I'm honoured to lead you.
To use a timely reference -
Shoulder to shoulder."
Lay siege to the mysteries of medicine.
We'll make the kind of progress
Hopkins used to be known for.
I know we will accomplish
great things together.
I'm looking
for my next watershed discovery,
not to put too modest a point on it.
It's not enough for us to be great surgeons.
We need to be outstanding researchers.
Any ideas? Anything innovative?
Skin grafts?
Testing what skin groups might take?
Excuse me, may I suggest something?
Please do. I'm very suggestible.
Tell us your name again.
Dr Longmire, Dr Kelven, Dr Cooley.
Oh, boy. Women and their hearts.
Vivien, would you get Dr Taussig a drink?
Let's lubricate the vein of inspiration.
Go on, Dr Taussig, tell us more.
It's something that up to now
has been written off as untreatable.
But I don't believe it has to be.
I'm speaking of Tetralogy of Fallot.
They're suffocating due to a blockage
in the main artery to the lung.
Pulmonary stenosis.
The mortality rate is 100%.
I've watched
hundreds of cyanotic children die.
I admitted a baby tonight
who will certainly die
because no one has had the courage
to attempt a surgical solution to this.
You can't operate on the heart.
to perform a correction
within three minutes.
By that time, they're dead.
There must be a way
to get more blood to the lungs.
I mean, I doubt we could
repair a defect in the heart walls...
Without causing ventricular fibrillation.
There may be a way to avoid
interfering with the circulation...
If we focus on the pulmonary artery.
Who on this God's earth are you?
OK, girl. Now go to sleep, baby.
The girls are just getting to bed?
Two-ton neighbour upstairs
nearly burst through the boards.
Get him to stop hollering his head off
when the girls is trying to sleep?
Try a devilled egg. They're real good.
Seen better in Nashville.
Yeah, and you said
if we didn't like it, remember?
We had a home in a good neighbourhood.
The schools were fine. Not living in this...
I don't know how we're gonna make it
on that pay cheque
and he got you serving drinks at his party
just to make ends meet. Come on.
Try to understand.
When I started at Vanderbilt I was a janitor.
Dr Blalock saw what I could contribute,
and he gave me a chance.
When they offered him the job in Detroit,
he didn't take it
because they didn't take me.
Now I'm a lab assistant to a top surgeon
at the number one medical school
in the country.
You don't have to remind me of that.
We have a family now.
Sweetheart, it's important work.
And it's a real opportunity
and I love what I'm doing.
So it doesn't really matter
how I feel, then, does it?
Clara, you know it matters.
See that man?
That's Johns Hopkins himself.
Sir William Osler,
the father of modern American medicine.
William Halstead, invented the mastectomy.
Let me show you some of the others.
Excuse me.
All workers punch in at the rear entrance.
Dr Blalock, Chief Surgical Professor.
I'm sorry, Dr Blalock, but that's the rules.
I'll meet you in the labs, Vivien.
Hey, you need to punch in first.
Thank you.
I can see we've arrived.
When was the last time
they used this place?
Have someone clean it up. I'll meet you
in an hour at the Harriet Lane wards.
Let's see if there's anything
in this idea of Dr Taussig's.
Where could I find someone
to help us clean up the lab, Doctor?
I'm Vivien Thomas,
I work for Dr Blalock, running this lab.
I'm Dr Edgar V Hecker.
Director of Laboratories.
I'd like some coffee and a doughnut.
Doctor.
There must be a mix-up.
Listen, I won't stand for insolence.
We'll see about this.
I can't hear too well in this ear.
You're one of the few women doctors
I've seen here.
At least they let me in
through the front door.
This is where we keep
some of the older kids.
Doctor, why do they squat like that?
A little boy told me
that it helps him breathe better.
It cuts off the blood to the legs,
pushes it up into the lungs.
They both look very cyanotic.
Here he is now.
Here is the Saxon baby
I was telling you about last night.
Thank you.
She usually smiles
when someone does that.
Hello, Mrs Saxon.
Reads how much oxygen
there is in the blood.
She looks cold in there.
But I can't hold her.
They say it isn't good for her.
I'm not even supposed to let her cry.
How do you keep a baby from crying?
Especially if you can't hold her.
You can see the change in the shape and size
of the vessels as these hearts grow.
I did necroscopies
on some of my patients' hearts
to study the malformations in detail.
It's amazing they could live at all
with hearts like these.
Dr Gross at Harvard
said only God could correct
a narrowing indentation
of the left side of the aortic arch.
Perhaps that statement says
more about Harvard than about God.
That baby back there. How long?
Six months. A year at the very most.
I want to see all your diagnostic notes.
I'll get them right away.
Thank you.
Put away the books, Vivien.
Let's not waste any more time
on theoretical crap.
Let's start with experiments.
Four separate defects of the heart
working in combination.
The pulmonary artery is constricted
in the main artery before the divide,
diminishing blood supply to both lungs.
And the hole in the septum
causes the used blood
to flow back into the arterial system
instead of flowing through the lungs,
turning the babies blue.
A baby's heart is delicate.
It's a goddamn minefield.
The first step is to see if we can create
the blue baby condition in a dog...
and then come up with a plan to solve it.
You drink too much coffee.
Balzac drank 300 cups of coffee in one day.
Of course, he died of a perforated ulcer.
Odds are against us
reproducing this in the laboratory.
Are you sure this is a limb
you want to climb out on?
Back in '29, when I had TB...
the x-rays showed a big gaping hole
in my left lung.
I laid there on a freezing porch
in a sanatorium in upstate New York
with 18 blankets on me.
Nothing but my nose
exposed to the elements.
Death's a very humbling thing to live with
day in and day out.
I swore then...
if I got my life back,
I would do something important with it.
I know, in every fibre of my being
that this is a limb I want to climb out on.
It'll be hell trying to work with a child's vessels
three or four millimetres thick.
Like sewing over
cooked spaghetti noodles.
We'll need the smallest sutures.
We'll need to make our own tools.
This goddamn war.
We don't have enough doctors.
My surgery cases are through the roof.
If I'm not operating, I'm teaching.
You're gonna have to do
most of this research.
What'll you need?
I need a bulldog clamp
small enough for the baby
but strong enough
to stop the flow of blood.
What about a breathing device?
I'd love a Positive Pressure Respirator,
but with this war going on...
How in hell can I do the experiments
if I can't even get the equipment?
Shut up.
You surely pissed off Ed Hecker.
You mean I disturbed his afternoon nap?
What is it with you
and that boy of yours? Thomas.
Why'd you bring him up here?
We've been together more than 12 years.
He's a really good worker.
How about a little wager?
There's a rumour going around
you're contemplating heart surgery.
That's an intriguing rumour.
Wouldn't it be a feather in our cap
if we were the first ones to do it?
Indeed, it would.
But I hope you'll forgive my scepticism.
There is no reason for us
to think it's possible.
And every indicator says it can't be done.
Most of us agree, Al, the risks are huge.
There isn't even any incremental progress.
Where you see risks, I see opportunity.
You gotta take care of that sink up in 4-B.
And you were gonna fix these steps.
Yes, forgive me,
I've been very busy at work.
The deal is $7 off for odd jobs every month.
You gotta pick up the pace.
This is good, sweetheart.
It's got some kick to it tonight.
It's the same as last night.
Just put it on a different side of the plate.
Sometimes it's better the next day.
I hope so, cos guess what?
Tomorrow it's hash à la king.
It's hash à la queen tonight.
I could get a job.
Who'll look after the girls?
I know it's not Nashville.
And I know... I wouldn't be able to do
what I'm doing without you.
My father took care of us,
I'll take care of you.
And everything's gonna be just fine.
We'll be just fine here.
You're right. We'll be fine here.
We're gonna run out of dogs at this rate.
It's been three months,
and all I'm closer to is retirement.
Things move slow sometimes.
No matter what you want.
I'm getting close. I've got 30% desaturation.
That dog was faintly blue at best. We must get
the dog in the same state as the baby.
I've tried nylon, ligature,
umbilical tape, ox facet.
We need a new approach.
OK, forget constriction.
Try a partial lobectomy.
Remove both lobes of the right lung.
Do an arteries-to-veins fistula,
where the medial wall of the aorta
and the pulmonary artery adhere.
I'll be in the OR.
That's a very good idea, Doctor.
Thank you.
With his condition,
you never had a chance.
I always have a chance.
Get me his autopsy.
Shit.
Damn.
I was rummaging around
the machine shop.
It's not pretty but it works.
It is pretty.
I knew I could count on you.
You're the only one I can trust around here.
I suspect others relish the thought
of seeing me fail.
Mary!
General Cunningham needed help
carting wounded Gl's off the ship.
So I volunteered to be a driver on the base.
I've got a lot of time on my hands.
She wouldn't go to bed?
Not until you came home.
You know what she said today?
She said she wanted to be a patient
when she grows up
so she can get to see her daddy.
I don't remember you wearing a tool belt
at your coming-out party.
Guess it has been a couple of weeks
since I made it home before 11:00.
No, it's 23 days.
Not as if I don't know
the lot of a doctor's wife.
But I miss you.
It's gonna change.
It's probably gonna get worse.
I don't know where he is.
You should check his office.
That's an interesting procedure.
Never seen a clamp like that before.
I pieced it together
from some things lying around.
Now we're getting somewhere.
You're not even looking.
It's like when you come home
late at night, you know?
You know the feel of the room in the dark.
You see, this string here?
That's how you get traction on the suture
cos you need a lot of exposure
for the anastomosis.
I'd like to work with you sometime.
Fine, Dr Longmire, that'd be fine.
My emergency rotation starts in ten minutes,
but I can come in on Thursday.
That'd be fine.
You have a good day, Doctor.
Supreme Court, finally made it.
A long time. You been working
on this case for what, nine years?
Time.
So, tell me, what was it like?
Nine white guys in big gowns
walked in first.
Then the school board lawyers.
Our lawyer, Thurgood Marshall,
he looked kind of lonely in there.
You know what them people
said in their brief?
Said since coloured teachers in Nashville
live so cheaply...
they should pay us
a whole lot less than white teachers.
But let me tell you,
Thurgood said he'd be goddamned
if they could get away with that.
So he gets up and says to that white lawyer,
The equal protection clause says
based on race."
Yes, Lord. I mean he was good, Viv.
I think we got the Board of Education
on the run.
That's good news, Harold.
So when will they decide?
Could be months, longer.
I don't know, but I can wait.
After all these years.
All those calls I got late at night.
White folk telling me they gonna kill me
if I don't drop this lawsuit.
No, you gotta show them
you won't take that treatment.
Wait. Listen to me when I tell you,
you need to leave this sorry-ass place
and that dead-end job.
Harold, Dr Blalock's
doing the best he can for me.
It's not enough.
He trusts me to carry out those experiments on
my own.
He said he regretted acting so grateful
for being free
for what wasn't any freedom at all.
I know, I remember.
What you giving him extra for?
What's wrong with me?
Nothing minding your own business
wouldn't cure.
You got that white coat, but you're just
a class three worker, same as me.
In fact, I got two years' seniority on you.
I'm making more than you.
Don't think you're
some kind of big shot around here.
Excuse me, buddy.
Class three. What does that mean?
It means salary grade.
And, ma'am, and this here? What's this?
Job classification.
What is class three?
Maintenance worker.
I'm a lab technician. That can't be.
OK. Here we go.
Thank you.
Any progress?
If you kill that dog,
I swear I will take it out of your pay cheque.
I'm finished here. Dr Longmire, would you mind
closing up for me? Thank you.
Come on, Vivien.
I was kidding
about taking it out of your pay cheque.
Good luck, cos I only make $16 a week.
That's all they can pay class three workers.
What are you talking about?
That's my job classification.
Who cares what they call you?
You and I both know
how valuable the work is that you do.
If my work is so important,
then why am I class three?
Two grades below what I do.
In classification and pay.
I don't know why.
I don't pay attention to bureaucratic details.
Look, at Hopkins you can't be a technician
without a college degree.
We have work to do.
Do I have your permission to do some work for
my landlord so I can pay my rent?
Dr Blalock, could you come here, please?
You're not gonna believe this.
Look at the oximeter.
The gums are blue, Doctor. Vivien did it.
Off, Alfred.
I brought him up here.
I gave him this opportunity.
I don't set the pay scale.
I just don't see what more I can do.
You're probably feeling guilty.
What the hell do I have to feel guilty about?
Sure. Why not?
You told me that was his dream.
I guess there's only so much good
one person can do.
Congratulations on the dog.
The kind of raise you're suggesting...
How important is this?
He makes it possible for me
to be in many places at the same time.
Can't you just hire a college kid?
No, I can't. His hands are important to me.
He's good at following my instructions.
Better than anyone I've encountered.
You want me to circumvent regulations
on behalf of a coloured helper?
Walter, I'm close
to accomplishing something.
I need him with me so I can continue with my
research. Can I count on your help?
Hello, Clara.
Dr Blalock.
Come in, sir.
Thank you.
Is Vivien at home?
Yes, he's putting the kids down.
You know, in 13 years, Dr Blalock,
I don't recall
you ever stopping by our house.
I don't recall ever being invited.
Professor. Did something happen?
Yes, I obtained a raise for you. $25 extra
a month on top of what you're making.
That's $300 for the whole year.
Promoted. To what he already does.
Excuse me.
Now you can pay your rent
and put all your focus on our research.
Back there in the lab with Pontius,
what did you do?
What you suggested. A partial fistula.
I stitched the main arteries
and veins together, end-to-end,
and two lobes in the lungs.
We created a blue baby's heart in that dog.
Did we?
Now we have our disease model,
we can find a cure.
And much as I enjoyed
coming here to see you,
would you mind terribly
if I got you a telephone?
No, not at all.
Thank you.
A shunt.
I'm sorry, Doctor. What'd you say?
We need to create a shunt
to get more oxygenated blood to the lungs.
Can't see how to do it.
Remember back in Vanderbilt
when we were doing the research
on how to create high blood pressure
in the lungs?
Yes, I connected the subclavian
to the pulmonary artery.
We failed to get the higher blood pressure
but we did get higher blood flow.
Which is exactly
what Dr Taussig said these babies need.
That's it. We build a bypass.
Take an artery and redirect it.
It's a long way around,
but it gets you there.
If we work from the right side,
we have an advantage there.
But the recurrent nerve is in the way,
and if we kink that...
We may kill the brain if we damage that.
Comforting thought.
The subclavian...
Tie it off here.
After the divide...
cut it right under the clavicle.
Swing it down.
Long, slow general arc.
Will it hold if we pull it down four inches?
If your hands don't get too excited.
Thank you for the vote of confidence.
No one's ever done anything
as hard as this.
Changing the course of blood.
And turn blue into pink.
And death into life.
I don't care what the chart says.
This girl wants to live.
Can't we try things my way occasionally?
Oh, all right. Sutures.
Do you mind
if I show you something, Doctor?
Thank you.
I have to purse-string the anastomosis.
OK, there. He's all yours, Doctor.
Do you feel the connection?
Are you sure you did this, Vivien?
This is like something the Lord made.
Look, Mr Saxon, Mrs Saxon.
I acknowledge that these
are uncharted waters. There are risks.
But I think we have found a way
to repair your daughter's heart.
How?
You're stationed, where,
Norfolk, is it, Mr Saxon?
Yes, sir. Been working on the Spencer,
trying to get her back out to sea.
I'd be changing around some of the piping
leading to and from your daughter's heart.
Arteries that bring the blood to and
from the heart to the lungs act like pipes.
I've been successful,
switching them around.
No surgery is. And this operation has special
complications.
But I still think it's worth doing.
It's going to be a lot harder with a baby.
We're going to have to collapse
one of her lungs.
She's already so cyanotic.
She's not getting enough oxygen
and we're going to have to take away
half of her lung function.
What if I shred her insides
with those clamps? So many ways to fail.
Every second counts.
A single minute is too long.
A single minute
of poor blood flow to the brain,
a single second of open bleeding...
Are you saying I shouldn't allow this doctor
to perform a miracle to save my baby?
We don't get to demand miracles.
Honey, God has his plans.
Maybe we just have to accept it.
But I was so happy
when I was pregnant with Eileen.
You know, I haven't had enough time.
Why can't God let me get to know her first?
I mean, I don't want to go against Him.
But why can't His plan be...
to let this doctor save her life?
Professor Blalock?
Mrs Saxon told me
you plan to operate on her baby.
And you're still going to proceed?
Have you had any success in the lab?
Absolutely. I successfully performed
a shunt on a dog just two weeks ago.
I can't imagine you're going to proceed
based on the laboratory success on a dog.
How many people have you saved?
You're performing an experiment,
not an operation.
My instincts tell me
nature made a mistake and I can fix it.
Would you like to see
what I've been doing, Father?
Right now my instincts tell me perhaps you
should come back another day.
What? Your quest for glory is vain, arrogant.
It takes arrogance to cut someone
to save their life.
I have no doubt.
But if you intervene with God's will,
violate the purity of an innocent heart,
the parents, not you, Doctor,
will bear the burden of guilt.
Perhaps God is, as you say,
trying to kill this child.
I am not.
Look at this. The shunt gave out.
Looks like a train wreck.
What happened to you, Pontius?
We using the wrong vessel?
What the hell's going on?
Viv, get up.
Wake up. It's OK.
It's OK, baby.
Where the hell have you been, Vivien?
I had a dream
about this white woman last night.
Perhaps that's something
best kept to yourself.
No. I knew it was Eileen Saxon.
She was all grown up.
She was sitting there in a corner.
She was knitting.
And she let out a baby voice
and she fell over dead.
I couldn't see it but I knew on the inside
she had a baby heart.
The stitches didn't grow.
When we did the shunt on Pontius,
he was ten pounds. He went up to 20.
We need a new stitching technique.
Continuous on the back wall, interrupted
on the front wall. That's what we need.
And then the shunt will grow.
She's deteriorating so rapidly.
You have to see this. Vivien Thomas is
operating, assisted by the Chief of Surgery.
Pull the inbound vein anastomosis.
Long, slow, general arc.
I can't see. Can you see, Vivien?
Could you adjust that lamp?
Are the clamps still holding?
None.
All right, now for the tough part.
Continuous sutures on the back wall...
interrupted on the front.
Removing bulldog clamp.
Come on, girl.
Come on, please.
That's it, a little bit more.
I can feel the flow to the lungs.
You'll be ready.
Yes, now that I've seen the master at work.
Master of the hounds.
Your daddy should be proud of you.
I think he is.
Mine was only proud of the fact
that I could wiggle my ears.
I think he'll be proud when you operate.
He's dead.
The dead are with us all the time, I believe.
Can't separate the past from the future
any more than you can
your right arm from your left arm.
But you see, they are separated
by this, by the heart.
Or connected.
Or connected.
Noli tangere. Do not touch.
Do not touch the heart.
We are gonna challenge
this ancient doctrinal myth in this hospital.
Who wants to attend?
Dr Swedlin?
Dr Philmore?
Dr Cooley.
And Dr Longmire.
Thank you.
You're dangling your reputation off a cliff.
Calm down. This isn't grand opera.
Isn't a doctor's first tenet, "Do no harm"?
What are you saying?
Postpone it until you have more experience.
That means signing that baby's death warrant.
Walter, I'm operating tomorrow.
You're rushing this because
you don't want to admit to those parents
that you spoke too soon.
Can I give you a ride
to the hospital tomorrow?
Thanks.
I could use the lift.
I don't trust myself behind the wheel.
Al, anybody would be nervous.
It's not that.
I was just thinking about a remark
you made.
You said I used to be wild,
not just ambitious.
But I wonder if my ambition
hasn't driven me wild.
Dr Taussig, Professor.
I just wanted to wish good luck
to everyone.
We're going to block that baby's
pulmonary artery for 30 minutes.
As long as her blood pressure doesn't go
below 60, I think she should be fine.
I don't think
she can survive much lower than that.
Dr Blalock, they're ready.
Doctor.
Coming in now.
Dr Longmire.
What is going on?
They won't page him.
Page Vivien Thomas immediately.
Dr Blalock, what's wrong?
It's all right.
I won't tell you again. Page him.
Vivien Thomas, paging Vivien Thomas.
This is Blalock.
Jesus.
About time. Scrub up.
You're talking me through this.
Now scrub up.
What's he doing here?
Should we say a prayer?
Forget it. He won't listen to me.
Dr Blalock, a word.
OK, I think we're ready to start.
OK. We're going in.
It's going to be all right. It'll be just fine.
She'll be all right.
lncising the mediastinal pleura
from the main left pulmonary artery.
To the apex of the pleural space.
I'm dissecting the pulmonary artery.
Well back into the mediastinum.
The right-angle clamp.
OK, I think it's holding.
Are you able to deliver
the left subclavian artery?
I believe so. Blood pressure?
Do not move that light.
And now...
I got it. Haemorrhage controlled.
Can you see, Doctor?
Not really. Nurse.
For goodness sake,
can't you even see my ears?
Sorry, Doctor.
Suture.
Watch the carotid.
We're about to connect the shunt.
Blood pressure is 60.
Now front, interrupted.
That's good, Doctor. Just a little more now.
Removing the bulldog clamp.
Good, you got it now.
Bleeding controlled.
I'm palpating the connection.
What do you feel?
I can't tell
if blood is flowing through the shunt.
It's just too small to feel anything.
Dr Blalock, you have to see this.
My God.
Her blood pressure is rising.
Evacuate the blood in the chest cavity.
Put in the chest tube.
Reinflating the left lung with oxygen.
Ready for closure.
Who would have thought it possible?
Heart surgery.
And we did it right here in Johns Hopkins.
I knew you could do it.
That child's chances were so slim. Took
a hell of a surgeon to pull her through.
He was lucky
to have that nigger in there with him.
Thomas sure saved his ass.
I'd like to see him try it without him.
You did well in there, Vivien.
Thank you.
You performed an excellent surgery, Doctor.
Yes.
I think I did.
Please. I understand. But this is a hospital.
Please keep your voices down.
I can understand how you all must feel
but we have been overwhelmed
with children
and there's just one doctor
to perform the operations.
So if you just go to the administration office,
they'll accommodate all of you into Dr Blalock's
schedule as soon as possible.
All right? I'm terribly sorry.
Making the first incision.
Thank you for the opportunity to observe,
Dr Blalock.
Thank you. May I introduce my colleagues.
Dr Helen Taussig, Vivien Thomas.
This is Dr Craford, from Stockholm.
And Dr Petrovsky from Leningrad.
You have given surgeons around the world
great courage with your deeds.
Coming from such an eminent surgeon
as yourself, that is a compliment, indeed.
It's been a pleasure to meet you,
Dr Taussig.
Call me Mr Thomas, or Vivien.
You're not a doctor?
No, I just work here with Dr Blalock.
Can we have the doctors who participated in
the "Blue Baby" operation in this shot?
There's a young woman who hitchhiked
from Appalachia with her son.
And I think his blood levels
may be low enough to test.
Talk to Dr Taussig
about scheduling him in.
If you'd all turn and face the centre, please,
like Dr Longmire.
Thank you,
now focus your attention here, please.
Smile, focus here. Hold that.
Good. Now if we could have
one of you alone, Dr Blalock.
Very good, sir. Focus here, if you would.
Here we go, Doctor.
Thank you very much.
They're nice pictures, aren't they?
They always have nice pictures.
Just cos you're not in the news
doesn't mean you weren't there, Viv.
I'll be back.
A man who is a real pioneer,
a gambler who takes all the right risks,
who's rescued untold lives
with his work in shock
and has gone on to challenge
the entire medical establishment
to reconsider an age-old taboo
in performing
the world's first heart surgery.
Now, without embarrassing myself,
I'd like to introduce a man
who has undeniably brought a dash of pink
to the cheeks of others.
Dr Alfred Blalock.
Thank you. I am indeed honoured.
And while I am grateful for the many gifts
that have been given to me in my life,
perhaps the greatest gift has been
the support of my colleagues
over this last year.
My good friend, Walter Dandy.
The wonderful, brilliant colleagues
who assisted me in our operation -
Dr Helen Taussig,
Dr William Longmire,
Dr Denton Cooley,
and Dr Merel Harmel.
I believe one group of people
could not have accomplished
so much in so little time
without a strong, unified effort
in the spirit of breaking new ground together.
To further the reach of medicine
is one that should be cherished
and never allowed to die.
What the hell is this?
I need to do something different.
What about our work?
You got all of those other people
you were thanking.
What are you talking about?
Belvedere Hotel.
The Belvedere is segregated.
You were there?
Snuck in, just like a bellhop.
Is this about hobnobbing
with the powers that be?
They will never let you into their club.
It is naive to think otherwise.
Will you stand still?
I'm not talking about them.
I'm not talking about Hopkins.
What have I ever done
except fight in your corner?
I have taken you every step of the way
with me,
and now you want to throw all that away?
For what?
Is that any way to show your gratitude?
I don't know. You tell me, Doctor.
Vivien, take pride in the fact you have power in
your mind and in your heart.
We made history together.
We changed the world.
The world.
I'm invisible to the world.
I don't mind that. I understand that.
I thought it was different in here.
Mr Thomas, I'm a little confused.
You want college credit for Morgan State
without actually taking classes?
In certain courses, yes.
I'll take the test. I'll take finals...
Chemistry, biochemistry, science, physics.
Also, I can get the credit
for material I already know.
I need to get through college a little more
quickly so I can get on to med school.
You actually participated in all this
groundbreaking research, Mr Thomas?
Yes, I did.
I'm afraid it just doesn't work like that.
You'll have to start with Freshman English.
Social Science, maybe.
I don't have time for that.
I'm 35 years old.
You're saying
that I have to start at the beginning?
Yes, Mr Thomas.
I'm afraid that is in fact what I'm saying.
I thought this institution
provided opportunity for coloured people?
I have a wife, two young daughters, son.
And I've been working in my field
for over...
Almost 15 years now.
I'm from Nashville, I came...
And what can I do for you?
My name is Vivien Thomas.
I work for the Ralph Wintham company.
We have a line of pharmaceuticals,
particularly antacids.
We already have a supplier of antacids.
Yes, well, these antacids
block against gastroesophageal reflux
The fellow with the blue babies?
A patient of mine who works at the hospital
told me about you.
Hopkins is doing well
because of what you did for them and...
here you are.
I don't have anything against the hospital.
I'm just working in medicine
in a different way now.
Let's see what other lines you have.
Yes, we have effervescent powder here...
Oh, William, look who's here.
My goodness.
How you doing, sweetheart? Look at him.
Stop running. Go up and wash your hands.
And bring your little sister down.
And be careful on them steps.
What about construction?
I keep asking him. "Thomas and Thomas".
With the building boom, we could clean up.
He know I can't saw a plank worth a damn.
I did see that mailbox
leaning to the side a little bit.
I don't understand why you quit teaching.
I never really liked the classroom
that much, Clara. Too many kids.
But you won the case so...
Exactly. And quitting now means
you've just wasted a whole lot of time.
If Harold wasn't doing what he was doing,
there'd still be a lot of coloured teachers
getting cheated.
Harold Thomas High.
No, most young teachers
don't know anything about that strike.
There's no point in waiting for the world
to thank you.
That bus ain't never going to come.
I'm looking for something that excites me
as much as hammering nails pleases you.
Viv, Jeopardy's on.
I'll be in in a minute.
You OK?
I'm fine.
Stomach's bothering me a little bit,
but I'm fine.
Why don't you take those fancy antacid pills
that you always brag about?
It's your brother?
I miss him. I miss the old Harold.
Seems a little lost now.
I miss you.
Still got my mind in that lab.
It's not just your mind, Viv.
It's your heart, too.
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do, Clara.
I think I've embarrassed myself enough.
I can't go back in there
with my tail between my legs.
It's where you belong, Vivien Thomas.
So how you walk back on in there,
well, that's up to you.
Yes?
Doctor. Good morning.
How was your trip to Europe?
It was very gratifying.
And how well it seems to have stood on its feet
for this moment in time.
What can I do for you, Vivien?
I've made a mistake...
and I would like my old position back.
How's it going to be any different?
I'm still the same self-righteous bastard.
It's not about you.
It's about the work.
I like the work.
We've got an animal going into shock here.
What do we do, sir?
Did you try clamping off
the lateral part of the atrium?
Yeah, hold it right there.
Yeah. You handled yourself
well there, Doctor.
It started...
There was a message for you, Mr Thomas.
Dr Blalock wanted to see you.
I'm sorry. Would you tell him I'll see him...
He's about to leave for the day.
Honey, I have to call you back. OK.
How's your girls?
They're fine. They're doing well.
Thea's at Morgan State now.
How are things with you?
I've had the unfortunate experience
of being put in the hands of a surgeon.
You have something on your mind, Doctor?
Yes, Columbia's been dangling
an offer to teach
but I wanted to talk to you first.
I really would like you to come with me.
They know about your work.
You could write your own ticket.
It's hard to imagine being there without you.
I thank you for thinking of me, Doctor.
But I think I should stay here.
We could do great things there.
Wouldn't it be fun to do it one more time?
One more time.
I like what I'm doing.
Teaching, helping people along.
Working with the young doctors.
I like it here at Hopkins.
Yeah, I guess you got your own things
going on here now.
I recognise this man.
Yes.
We all are now.
You know, Vivien...
they say you haven't really lived...
unless you have a lot to regret.
I regret...
I have some regrets.
But I think we should remember
not what we lost...
but what we've done.
All the lives we saved, and we did.
No.
Vivien, it's Helen.
I'm sorry to tell you that Dr Blalock
passed away in his sleep last night.
We see death every day.
It doesn't make it any easier, does it?
I'm very sorry.
Today, we honour someone
who never took a course in medical school
and still became
one of our greatest teachers of medicine.
This individual helped change the way
we understand how the human heart works.
And now I'm honoured to read...
the Johns Hopkins University...
and a skilled clinical technician,
awarded this honorary doctorate
Congratulations, Dr Thomas.
Thank you, Dr Taussig.
I'm not accustomed
to being in the limelight.
So being placed in the position
I find myself in now
makes me quite humble
and a little proud.
When I put my hammer and saw down
and was offered an opportunity
to work with a young surgeon,
I had no idea
that I'd be able to make a mark
on an institution as prestigious as this one.
I had no idea that I would have
any contribution to make to medicine
that would merit this type of recognition.
I simply say thank you to all of my family
and all of my friends who are here,
and to all of my friends
who could not be here.
I thank you very much.
This is also a special occasion.
to mark the unveiling
of your likeness, Vivien.
