What is it?
I wasn't dreaming, Walt.
I didn't imagine it.
I heard him. I heard him. I heard him.
I heard Chris.
No. I wasn't imagining it, Walt.
No, I did. He's... He's...
That's about as far as I can get you.
All right. Thank you.
Suit yourself.
Thanks again.
Hey, hold on a minute.
Here, take these.
They'll keep your feet dry.
If you make it out alive, give me a call.
My number's inside the boots.
Thanks.
Hello?
Is there anybody here?
Guess not!
Two years he walks the earth.
No phone, no pool, no pets,
Ultimate freedom.
An extremist. An aesthetic voyager
whose home is the road.
Now, don't psychoanalyze me, all right?
I'm taking you out to where we're going."
So now, after two rambling years
comes the final and greatest adventure.
The climactic battle to kill
the false being within
and victoriously conclude
the spiritual revolution.
No longer to be poisoned
by civilization, he flees,
and walks alone
upon the land to become
lost in the wild.

and congratulations.</i>
of their colleges.</i>
under the ochre sandstone arch,</i>
of blood behind his head.</i>
with a few light books at her hip,</i>
bricks with the wrought-iron gates</i>
its sword-tips black in the May air.</i>
They are kids. They are dumb.</i>
they would never hurt anybody.</i>
he's the wrong man.</i>
you cannot imagine you would ever do.</i>
to children.</i>
in ways you never heard of.</i>
in the late May sunlight and say it.</i>
paper dolls, and bang them together</i>
to strike sparks from them. I say,</i>
and I will tell about it."
Here they are, Walt. Okay?
Who wrote that?
Well, could have been either one of us,
couldn't it?
Why is he letting Carine drive his car?
There's a lot of great poems in here.
I have to speak to her about it.
Sit down.
Excuse me. I'm going to get my son.
He just graduated today
from Emory College.
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Chris, hi!
We've been waiting and waiting.
You scared me half to death
jumping up there on that stage like that.
All right.
You're not supposed to be driving
in Georgia.
Why? I have my permit.
for a learner's permit
to drive in another state
from one's home state. That's why.
I didn't know that. I thought that if I was
with a legal driver that it'd be okay.
Well, let's...
I guess everybody's celebrating today.
My grades are good enough, I think,
to get into Harvard Law.
Chris, that's wonderful.
That is a big deal.
How much do you have left
in the college fund?
Exactly $24,500.68.
Well, that's specific.
I had to go to the bank
this morning, Mom.
Your mother and I will be glad
to contribute the balance for Harvard.
That's right.
I've got to figure out
what I'm going to do.
I've got a lot of things
to pack and organize here first.
Your father and I,
we want to make a present to you.
We want to get you out of that junker.
What junker?
That.
A new car?
Why would I want a new car?
Datsun runs great.
Do you think I want some fancy boat?
Are you worried
what the neighbors might think?
Well, we weren't gonna get you
a brand new Cadillac, Chris.
We just want to get you a nice new car
that's safe to drive.
And you never know when that thing
out there just might blow up.
Blow up. Blow up?
Are you guys crazy? It's a great car.
I don't need a new car.
I don't want a new car.
Maybe he just wants his old car.
It's not such a big deal.
Thank you. I just don't want anything.

Bye, Chris!

Oh, yes. He left two months ago.

Did you know about this?
He didn't say anything.
That he had spent four years</i>

and material excess,</i>
from the truth of his existence.</i>
Hey!
We barely saw you there
underneath that crazy hat of yours.
This door's a little tricky.
There you go. Hop in.
That's Rainey.
Alex with the hat on.
So you're a leather now.
I'm a leather?
Yeah, a leather tramp. That's what they
call the ones that hoof it, go on foot.
Technically we're rubber tramps.
Because we have a vehicle.
Yeah, Alex could have a vehicle as well,
but he decided to burn all of his money.
And why did you do that?
I don't need money.
Makes people cautious.
Come on, Alex.
You gotta be a little cautious.
I mean, that book of yours is cool
and everything,
but you can't depend entirely
on leaves and berries.
I don't know if you want to depend on
much more than that.
Where are your mom and dad?
Living their lies somewhere.
You look like a loved kid. Be fair.
Fair?
You know what I mean.
I'll paraphrase Thoreau here.

Jeez. If I struck a match to you I'd have

Where's Jan going?
Well, my friend,
all is not well on the hippie front.
You're an industrious little fucker,
aren't you?
Little bit.
It's funny how things happen
at particular times.
I've loved that woman
for a lot of years, bro.
But, you know, she's got a story.
We've been going through this thing,
real quiet.
So when we ran into you yesterday,
this thing that we've been going
through real quiet,
she's talking about it.
You know what I mean?
Well...
Some people feel like
they don't deserve love.
They walk away quietly
into empty spaces,
trying to close the gaps to the past.
That's a hell of an insight. Jesus!
You gonna walk across the water
and get her back for me, pal?
No. I'm afraid of water.
Always have been.
Something I've gotta get over sometime
though, huh? So I will swim in it
if you'll carry the firewood back to camp.

There's a big wave coming!
Rainey, I'm freezing!
Could you put your arms around me?
The Navy bulldozed and abandoned this
base down there,
and all that's left is this huge grid
of concrete foundations, or slabs.
Fellow travelers.
Just living on the cheap under the sun.
Can't beat it.
Sounds good.
If you come, I'll make you a proper hat.
Oh, baby. Baby.
Let me turn off the light.
And how will it grow?</i>
I mean, you're really good.
I mean, you're like
any apple I've ever had.
I'm not Superman, I'm Supertramp.
You're Superapple.
You're so tasty.
You're so organic, so natural.
You're the apple of my eye.
Too fast to fold</i>
Lo and behold</i>
got a call from the Annandale police</i>
Chris' abandoned car</i>
by the Arizona Highway Patrol.</i>
stumbled upon it in the desert.</i>
Chris had intended to return to it.</i>
any evidence of struggle, either.</i>
Chris had chosen to leave it behind</i>

Strong.
You can do anything.
You can go anywhere.
It's up here.</i>
You can be here.
Me and you.
One, two. No, no, no.
Two,
three...
Don't be shy with it. Get it moving there.
That's good.
You go too fast,
you won't get all the wheat.
That's it, straight line, straight line,
little straighter.
See how you're bearing? Just a little
straighter. Now you're a combiner.
Wow, look at this view!
But keep your eye on the wheat, here.
Make sure you're cutting it.
You can look back here and see
how much is coming out, all right.
Okay, keep it straight. God bless you.
Make yourself some money, my friend.
I'll see you in a little bit.
Okay.
Wayne. Where you going?
Kevin, you know I love you.
I'm joking with you. I'm joking. Stop it.
Me and you are on the same side.
We're on the same side.
Let me get some...
If I want some vagina, let me get it.
I just wanna see
everybody going for broke.
We're at 260.
We're gonna stay right at 260,
that's our number.
We've got 20,000 pounds.
We've got 20,000 pounds
we need to get rid of.
Maybe just do all that after lunch
before we get back into everything else.
Can we do the $500 reserves...
What do you think about all this?
I like all this.
I don't think he can do it.
Is there a library
or bookstore around here
where I can get books
on hunting and preserving?
Anything at all to do with hunting
or preserving the meat,
smoking it, whatever the hell it is,
talk to Kevin over there.
That's your man.
Outdoorsman. What's your fascination
with all that stuff?
I'm going to Alaska.
Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?
Because they do have markets
in Alaska.
The city ofAlaska. Not in Alaska.
In the city ofAlaska, they have markets.
No, man. Alaska, Alaska.
I'm gonna be all the way out there,
all the way fucking out there.
Just on my own.
You know, no fucking watch,
no map, no ax, no nothing. No nothing.
Just be out there. Just be out there in it.
You know, big mountains, rivers,
sky, game.
Just be out there in it, you know?
In the wild.
What are you doing when we're there?
Now you're in the wild,
what are we doing?
You're just living, man.
You're just there, in that moment,
in that special place and time.
Yeah.
Maybe when I get back,
I can write a book about my travels.
Why not?
You know,
about getting out of this sick society.
Society, you know! Society!
what I don't understand?
I don't understand why people,
why every fucking person
is so bad to each other so fucking often.
It doesn't make sense to me. Judgment.
Control. All that, the whole spectrum.
You know, parents, hypocrites,
politicians, pricks.
This is a mistake.
It's a mistake to get too deep
into all that kind of stuff.
Alex, you're a hell of a young guy,
a hell of a young guy.
But I promise you this.
You're a young guy! Can't be juggling
blood and fire all the time!
I'm talking about blood and fire.
We're talking about
trying to juggle blood and fire.
Who are you to be giving advice
to anybody anyway?
Who am I to be giving advice
to anybody?
And Mr. Happy sometimes gives advice.
Sometimes Mr. Happy...
Well, Mr. Happy is always happy.
But you know when he's happiest?
Are you really gonna say that to me?
Come on, tell me about it.
I am going to say that to you.
One thing that you should try
to keep your eye on
is what happened
in the late 1940s in Roswell.
revealed that</i>
his life savings to charity,</i>
what Dad called "mobilized."</i>
notified law enforcement nationwide,</i>
far from the eyes of the law.</i>
These are those free satellite TV deals.
You're the one who said it, Alex, not me.
You're gonna need something.
What kind of gun you got?
I'm probably gonna get like a.22,
I think. A.22 caliber rifle.
All right, then.
When you get your kill,
time is of the essence.
Now, the first thing you wanna do
is make sure
that you got that meat
nice and shaved up.
And you don't have a lot of time to do
this. This is about an hour or two.
Depending on the weather. Especially if
it's hot, you've got less time to do it.
What you do is you want to make sure
that them flies don't land on your meat.
Because once them flies start
shitting out larvae and them maggots,
you know, those creepy crawlies,
it's too late. It's too late.
You got me. You got me.
I warned Wayne
about them little black boxes.
Mr. Westerberg, Scott Baker, FBI.
I think you know why we're here.
You mind grabbing that zipper
for me there? Thank you.
We're gonna have to shut down
for a little while.
Alex, you come back
and work for me any time you want.
Gil's got your checks, guys.
I shouldn't be away too long.
Remember Alex, no Alaska till spring.
South, kid. You wanna head south.
and drove it cross-country.</i>
Come on. The neighbors
are gonna be watching, honey.
Can you spray it?
I ran into his room to talk to him.</i>
he'd looked up some old family friends.</i>
of how they fell in love and got married</i>
masking an ugly truth.</i>
Dad was already married.</i>
with his first wife, Marcia,</i>
Chris and me as bastard children.</i>
oblivious to the pain he caused.</i>
embarrassment of a young mistress,</i>
a weakness but a fineness.</i>
a fine crystal glass had to be cared for</i>
they did not seem to know or care</i>
that could cut them.</i>
and our father's denial of this other son</i>
a murder of every day's truth.</i>
like a river suddenly reversing</i>
suddenly running uphill.</i>
of Chris' sense of identity.</i>
seem like fiction.</i>
I can't afford four.
Who's gonna pay for the fourth one?
Bryan can't afford four. Does it matter?
Can I help you?
Yeah. If I wanted
to paddle down the river,
where's the best place to launch out of?
Hang on a second.
What's your experience level?
A permit? Permit for what?
You can't paddle down the river
without a permit.
If you want, you can apply for one here,
get some experience,
and I'll put you on the wait-list.
No, I got this guy in here.
We'll figure it out.
There's a wait-list
to paddle down a river?
That's right.
Yeah, hang on a second.
Now, the deal is
it's gonna be me and you
or it's gonna be me, you and her.
Next available is May 17th, 2003.
Great. Done. The three of us, then.
Twelve years?
To paddle down a river.
Let me call you back.
You can do that,
or you can join a commercial raft trip,
go with a licensed guide.
They may have some
last-minute cancellations,
but that's gonna cost you $2,000.
Thank you very much.
Helmet, man!
I'm Supertramp!
can be ruled by reason,</i>
Hello!
Hello.
Come. Join us.
We have hot dogs.
Hey. I'm Sonja.
Hey, Alex.
We are from Copenhagen,
and you are from the rapids.
I am.
Sonja, get away from him. Get away
from him. He's crazy! Look, he's crazy.
I'll make you a hot dog. One minute.
I love this. Don't you love this?
You know, this is nature.
So where are you going?
Well, we like it here very much.
And it's so good to meet you, man.
So good to meet you.
You know, we went to Los Angeles,
and then we went to Las Vegas.
Oh, yeah. Las Vegas is very nice.
The universe is so good.
Just the place. The city, she means.
Her English is not very good.
But then we came here. I don't care
if she's a little stupid, but I like her.
You know you can actually go
all the way down to Mexico from here.
You can take the kayak,
and you can take it all the way around
down to Hoover Dam,
you can sail around,
and then from there you can take
the river all the way down to Mexico!
Come on, come on!
She's so slow sometimes.
About 330 kilometers, I think.
You know, I wonder if I could paddle
all the way down that
into the Gulf of California.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.
You know, I will go with you.
I will go with you. We leave Sonja here,
and then we take the kayak.
No, no.
We go all the way down into Mexico.
You know, because in every man's
heart, there is a Mexican mistress.
Oh, man.
I've gotta go, you guys.
I'm really sorry. I gotta go.
The river patrol's after me. I'm actually
not supposed to be here, you know.
You have to have, like, a permit,
it's like a government thing to be here,
and I didn't get one.
If you see anybody,
any of the rangers or anything,
just tell them you didn't see me, okay?
Okay.
Okay, again, I'm really, really sorry,
man. I wish I could stay, you know.
Take care, man.
Say hello to Mexico from me.
Bye, Alex!
in a couple of months,</i>
was about his car being found.</i>
and for the first time, it bothered me</i>
who hadn't heard from Chris.</i>
Honey?
It's me. I'm sorry.
Everything that happened, it's my fault.
Give me another chance.
Please do that... Come on.
Do that for me.
Come on. They're calling
for another quarter right now,
and I ain't got it, so will you hurry it up?
Come on now, don't hang up on me.
Hey, here's a quarter.
Thank you.
There's a quarter
just happened out of the sky,
so I'm on here talking to you again.
I got the quarter now, let's...
No, no, no, no, no!
in case I might answer.</i>
maybe through a friend?</i>
to bear with the not knowing.</i>
was something more than rebellion,</i>
had always been an adventurer.</i>
from home at 3:00 in the morning.</i>

must have something pretty sweet in it.</i>
in the first place?</i>
beyond there, doesn't it?</i>
canals, thanks to our dams up north.</i>
and I hitched down to Golfo.</i>
came up and blew the kayak away.</i>
the borders without any identification.</i>
I've eaten enough sand to send me
back to the city anyway.
All right. Sit tight. I'll be right back.
The world could wait no longer.</i>
Hi. Do you have the time?
Yeah.
Okay.
Front and back.
I don't have any more clipboards,
so get one from the other fellas.
Can you tell me how to get an ID?
No birth certificate? Nothing?
Ouch.
All right. Well, you're gonna
have to work that out with the DMV.
You can catch them in the morning.
The closest one is Montebello,
and we can help you
with the bus voucher.
So just come to this desk
when you're ready for the voucher.
Yeah.
Okay, so I'm gonna look for you,
Supertramp. I got something for you.
Okay, baby.
Do you have a bed for me? I'm sorry...
Oh, no. Sure, I got a bed for you.
Sign your name right here.
You fill this out. And I'll set you right up.
Now, I'm out of...
Supertramp, huh?
You know the drill.
Move it!
Thanks, but I'm not gonna need
that bed after all.
You leaving us so soon? Supertramp!
Show me your face.
I never, ever, ever forget a face.
If I see yours again,
I won't arrest you, I'll kill you.
This is the goddamned railroad,
and we will do whatever we have to do
to keep you freeloaders
from violating our liability.
Yes, sir.
You got any ID?
Last time, my friend.
All clear.
Good boy!
Finally!</i>
With which we have agreed</i>
than you need</i>
You think you need</i>
Your thoughts begin to bleed</i>
more than you think</i>
Thanks a lot.
Chris wrote me from college,</i>
with Mom and Dad had continued.</i>
the only person in the world</i>
what he had to say.</i>
With whose money are you buying
all these goddamn presents?
I work. The only reason
I'm not talking is because
you're wandering around acting like
the big-shot flirt with everybody.
I am making the contacts
for this business to work!
You don't care at all about what I do!
I don't even want to talk to you
about it anymore!
Don't you walk away from me, woman!
Woman!
Kids! Look what your dad
is doing to me!
For God's sake,
look what your mother is making me do!
Fuck you! I hate you!
There ain't gonna be no party.
I'm gonna cancel Christmas this year.
Who do you think you are? God?</i>
You can't cancel Christmas.</i>
We're 10 deep!
Alex, I don't mean to be on you about
everything. You're doing a great job.
I wanna keep you on and
we all wanna help you get to Alaska,
but you've got to start wearing socks.
since Chris' disappearance,</i>
whenever she passes a stray.</i>
of a loss so huge</i>
at taking its measure.</i>
all that Chris is saying any longer,</i>
he grew up with,</i>
reflection that comes with loss.</i>
has to be said.</i>
everything he is doing has to be done.</i>
Big game. Very big game.
Got it.
Damn it!
Get off!
please, Dad, this time?"
you can go get the lighter fluid."
That sounds like a good idea..."
Don't make me tell you again. Okay?
You hear me, woman?"</i>
Shit.
No! No! Damn it!

and superstitious rites,</i>

Sunni.
Hey, Sunni! Come here, baby.
No. No!
But now all I'm focused on
is just Alaska.
for Slab City's own Tracy T!</i>
Jack London is king.
Hey, you gonna stay with us long?
Well, I'm waiting on a check
from my last job
to come into Salton City
the day after Christmas.
I've got to start thinking about
getting ready for Alaska.
When the sun gets a little lower tonight,
I'm going to start a calisthenics routine.
After the check comes in,
I think I'm gonna try to find
some big old mountains I can climb
every day until spring comes.
I've got to see
how far the money's gonna go.
I've still got a lot of supplies
to pick up before spring.
So, I might get anotherjob
or I might be okay.
Hell, we'd give you a little something for
the days you spend in the booth here.
I'm not taking
any money from you, Rainey.
It's been a real great twist
meeting you two.
You two look like you're doing good.
We're doing real good.
Speaking of which, don't you think
you ought to introduce yourself
to our little Joni Mitchell over there?
I...
You selling these books?
I am. We are.
He was.
I like to read.
That's good.
I heard you play your song last night.
Thank you.
I was gonna go take a walk
to Salvation Mountain.
I'd like to show you around up here.
I've been here since 1984, more or less.
A lot of tourists come in here
and they look at that car door up there.
They really like it.
And I found car doors and put them
up there and I bolted it all in.
Where did you get the telephone poles?
A lot of people in the valley
just love me a lot.
Everybody now, I think,
in the whole world is just loving me.
And I want to have the wisdom
to love them back.
And that's about it.
So I really get excited.
You really believe in love, then.
Yeah. Totally.
This is a love story that is staggering
to everybody in the whole world.
That God really loves us a lot.
Does that answer that?
I really love it here. I think the freedom
of this place is just so beautiful.
To me, I wouldn't move for $10 million,
unless I had to.
So I'm contented here in the desert,
and I'm living where I want to live.
And I think good gets better.
And I think those great big tanks there
were the sewer plant for
the Marine base in World War II.
If you want to,
you can try putting your hands in there.
And I'm gonna do the same thing,
just for the fun.
You're doing real good.
You can wipe your hands off on my shirt
if you want.
This is starting to make me hungry.
I was just a couple of years older
than Tracy when I got pregnant.
Yeah, I thought my husband and I were
going to just make peace on Earth
and babies and love
and stay together forever,
and that didn't quite work out that way.
He left me.
So, I...
Anyway, whatever,
but I ended up raising Reno on my own.
That's my boy, his name's Reno.
Then I met Rainey.
That was sweet.
It was really good for a while. It's just...
You know, Reno was
a teenager already by then,
and he was just on his way
to becoming his own man.
And I haven't even heard from him
in two years.
I don't even know where he is.
I hope I get to meet him sometime.
Do your folks know where you are?
Hey, guys?
Dinner's ready if you guys are hungry.
Yeah, we are. We're hungry.
I'll be all right.
You want to come and eat?
Or we'll sit here.
Because I will sit here with you all night.
Let's go. Let's go.
Guys, come on. It's getting cold.
Check this out. Tawdry?
Denise, that sounds like your cup of tea.
That poor girl is about ready
to vault herself onto a fence post.
And here you are,
the monk of Jack fucking LaLanne.
Children can be pretty harsh
when it comes to their parents.
You planning on seeing yours?
I've only got one plan, Rainey.
That would be Alaska?
Alaska.
Hello?
My parents went into town.
No.
Yeah. They went to call my grandma
for Christmas.
No, I mean we can't do that.
Why not?
How old are you?
Eighteen.
Seventeen.
What year were you born?
So I'm 16.
You want to do something together?
You can send mail to this address
in South Dakota.
I don't know when I'm going to get it,
but I'll get it.
You're pretty magic.
And just remember
if you want something in life,
reach out and grab it.
Just get your pack
and get on out of here, okay?
I don't think I could take a hug.

Where's your camp?
Just out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.
I've lived in and around here
for six years now
and I've never heard of any place
that goes by that name.
Alex? Where you from, Alex?
Well, this is something out here.
Don't you...
Don't you worry about those dope
smokers and nudists down below there?
No, they keep to themselves
pretty much.
You strike me as a bright young man.
Am I wrong about that?
I think I've got
my head on my shoulders pretty good.
Well, that's what I mean.
How long you been out here?
A lot of places.
Been moving around a lot.
Twenty-three years old!
Son, don't you think
you ought to be getting an education?
And a job?
And making something of this life?
Look, Mr. Franz,
I think careers are a 20th century
invention, and I don't want one.
You don't need to worry about me.
I have a college education.
I'm not destitute.
I'm living like this by choice.
That's a shame.
Hey, Mr. Franz,
I want to show you something.
Come on.
It's getting a little steep.
A little high for me, kid.
All right,
but even from halfway out,
it's quite a sight, isn't it?
From the top, you can see all the way
to the Salton Sea, too.
You can see the Salton Sea
from up there?
Yes, sir.
My goodness.
I spent most of my life in the Army.
New Year's Eve, 1957,
I was stationed in Okinawa.
My wife and son were here in the States
just driving down the road,
and some fella who'd had too much
to drink plowed right into them.
Killed them both.
Now you might think
the last thing I would do in the world
is go to the whiskey.
But at the time,
it felt like the only thing I could do.
And I did it hard!
But pretty soon I realized
I wasn't doing my wife and son any good
mourning them with the bottle.
So I pulled myself together
and I quit drinking,
cold turkey.
So since all that, this is pretty much me.
Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?
No, I can't seem to get too far
from my leather.
I do a lot of leather engraving.
I got a little workshop out in the garage.
Between that and my pension,
I do pretty well.
But every time I think
I might take a trip somewhere,
I get too far behind on orders and such
to consider it.
When we finish eating,
I'd love to see your workshop.
I was hoping you'd say that.
When the leather is wet you can really...
It's amazing. And then it hardens up,
and, I mean, it stays right there.
A good whack with the mallet.
Crack it down. Whack. Bang.
I went to South Dakota.
I worked at a grain elevator
for this guy named Wayne.
He was a really good guy.
So I took the Colorado River
all the way down through
the Grand Canyon and did rapids,
which is by far one of
the scariest things I've ever done.
And I took the Colorado down into
Mexico, Golfo, where I got stuck.
Salvation Mountain. The Slabs.
What's the "N" stand for?
North.
Alaska?
Son, what the hell
are you running from?
You know, I can ask you
the same question!
Except I already know the answer!
You do, do you?
I do, Mr. Franz!
You got to get back out in the world!
Get out of that lonely house,
that little workshop of yours.
Get back out on the road! Really!
You're going to live a long time, Ron!
You should make a radical change
in your lifestyle!
I mean, the core of man's spirit
comes from new experiences.
And there you are, stubborn old man,
sitting on your butt.
I'll show you sitting on my butt!
I'll show you!
Come on, then! Come on.
Sitting on my butt? Yeah.
Come on, old man. Come climbing.
Sitting on my butt.
Come on. Keep going!
You're doing great!
Can anybody see this?
God, are you watching this right now?
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you when you go.
I'll miss you, too, Ron.
But you're wrong if you think
that the joy of life comes principally
from human relationships.
God's placed it all around us.
It's in everything.
It's in anything we can experience.
People just need to change the way
they look at those things.
Yeah, I'm gonna take stock of that.
No, I am.
I am.
But I wanted to tell you something.
From the bits and pieces I put together,
you know, from what you told me about
your family, your mother and your dad.
And I know you've got your problems
with the church, too.
But there's some kind of bigger thing
we can all appreciate,
and it sounds like
you don't mind calling it God.
But when you forgive,
you love.
And when you love,
God's light shines on you.
I told you so!
Where are the fucking animals now?
I'm hungry!

Hi.
What are you doing up?
It's 3:30 in the morning.
I heard you get off the couch
about a half hour ago.
Had a funny feeling
you might not be here for our breakfast.
I'm gonna drive you 100 miles to
someplace where you can catch a train,
a plane or hitch a ride
and not get stuck out in this desert.
I'd take you all the way to Alaska
if I didn't have an 8:00 mass.
Get you started on this thing of yours.
On your great Alaskan adventure.
Here. Here's a machete.
Collapsible fishing pole, a few other
odds and ends I stuck in there for you.
I'll get dressed
and meet you in the truck.
Well, my friend.
Yep.
I had an idea.
You know, my mother was an only child
and so was my father,
and I was their only child,
so when I'm gone,
I'm the end of the line.
My family will be finished.
What do you say you let me adopt you?
I can be, say, your grandfather.
Ron,
could we talk about this
when I get back from Alaska?
Would that be okay?
Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Yeah.
All right, Ron.
Thank you.
